{"nick":"enk0re","message":"mkozjak: why not just pick one version? i keep using v1/generators until async/await is stable on node/without babel etc. you use koa-compose to wrap together middleware functions","date":"2016-04-23T11:39:25.394Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mkozjak","message":"enk0re: seems like v2 is a stepping stone. once v3 goes in, i believe that's the master and every lib should be async/await.
