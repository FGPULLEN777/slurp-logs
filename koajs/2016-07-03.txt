{"nick":"ArchNoob","message":"the examples are all in koa v1!","date":"2016-07-03T10:44:01.127Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ArchNoob","message":"and thought it would be nice if i get to make v2","date":"2016-07-03T10:45:03.124Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jammi","message":"and the examples are/were confusing, especially since there's no clear distinction on which are for koa1 and which are koa2. classic second system effect","date":"2016-07-03T10:48:11.482Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jammi","message":"so I mostly resorted to koa's version 2 github branch's stuff and the source of it","date":"2016-07-03T10:48:59.786Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"danneu","message":"jammi: you dont use yield or await?","date":"2016-07-03T10:49:06.244Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ArchNoob","message":"yeah","date":"2016-07-03T10:50:27.656Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jammi","message":"basically just a broker and the rest of the system is proprietary and distributed","date":"2016-07-03T10:51:12.414Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"danneu","message":"yeah, you use babel compiler for that","date":"2016-07-03T10:52:31.382Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"danneu","message":"compiles it to generators afaik","date":"2016-07-03T10:52:42.525Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ArchNoob","message":"yeah","date":"2016-07-03T10:52:47.626Z","type":"message"}
