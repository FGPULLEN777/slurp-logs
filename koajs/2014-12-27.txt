{"nick":"hmsimha","message":"I'm trying to get up to speed in a codebase that uses Koa with Mongoose as quickly as possible. I've read over the Koa docs (and played with ES6 generators) and I've noticed that Koa doesn't really have a model component (which is new to me since rails is the only web framework I have experience with).
