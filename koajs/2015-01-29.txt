{"nick":"hmsimha","message":"Hi, I'm working with a project that uses Koa with Mongoose, and I'm wondering if the models that have been created are fatter than they should be. For example, we use sendgrid's API for sending email, and upon a user signing up, the code to send them their email confirmation will be in a model method.. does this sound right, or should this kind of thing either have its own middleware or be done from the router?","date":"2015-01-29T03:11:13.093Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"hmsimha","message":"I think the original developer didn't really put a clear distinction between controllers and models into place, so a lot of what I think would be considered the main action ends up being done by model methods","date":"2015-01-29T04:10:34.702Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"hmsimha","message":"Yeah I did Rails for an internship, but I was actually a little bit overwhelmed by all the magic.

{"nick":"hmsimha","message":"yes, I think this more fuzzy distinction is causing some confusion in the team currently, because the person who set everything up had routes delegate to model methods for a lot of things, and in some cases different routes delegate to the same model method that then handles them differently, causing the execution to be very spaghetti-like","date":"2015-01-29T04:38:19.457Z","type":"message"}
