{"nick":"TBotV63","message":"Essentially it's future-proofing for ES7. It will introduce the async keyword and native handling for promises, which will render wrapped generators useless","date":"2015-11-13T22:15:26.170Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"TBotV63","message":"Just not in this specific use case. Here they're just being used as a way of passing async operations / promises to an abstraction framework. But generators have way more use cases than that","date":"2015-11-13T22:17:17.815Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"TBotV63","message":"ES7 will probs come out in a year and a few monts I'd say, but I have no idea ;) As for ES6, it is now mostly (if not fully?) supported by node. Unsupported ES6 will be handled by babel aswell.","date":"2015-11-13T22:29:00.535Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"doburg","message":"Well, what I meant to express is that I worry about committing myself to new ecmascript features because I feel like I run the risk of getting into something which could potentially never really be supported","date":"2015-11-13T22:30:28.988Z","type":"message"}
