{"nick":"mezod","message":"i'm using koa for an api and I am realizing I need to do a lot of queries to the database to check if a user owns a resource, so that it can make an action","date":"2015-11-06T00:05:50.713Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mezod","message":"do you know if this is the normal way to go?","date":"2015-11-06T00:06:02.424Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mezod","message":"this was poorly explained...","date":"2015-11-06T00:06:07.432Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"danneu","message":"mezod: sounds about right. do you have an example?","date":"2015-11-06T00:11:04.011Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TBotV63","message":"mezod, Like... how many queries? One or two are normal. If you see that the queries are slowing your application down, try applying caching.","date":"2015-11-06T00:11:17.291Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mezod","message":"well, one extra query for each request","date":"2015-11-06T00:11:50.697Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"danneu","message":"mezod: when possible, try to bake it into the actual query so you can do one round trip. for example, instead of seeing if user owns widget before updating widgets where widget_id = 42, instead write your update query to update widgets where widget.id = $1 AND widget.user_id = $2","date":"2015-11-06T00:12:50.514Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mezod","message":"it just feels dumb, I mean, i have an object with user_id and list_id, can't bookshelf/mysql see that the user_id doesn't match when saving instead of updating the user_id :D","date":"2015-11-06T00:17:48.147Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"danneu","message":"it's standard to have middleware that loads `this.currentUser` from a session_id before all your routes (roundtrip1), then load `resource` in GET '/resources/:id' (roundtrip2), assert that resource.user_id===this.currentUser.id, and then do whatever it is that the route does (roundtrip3)","date":"2015-11-06T00:19:36.796Z","type":"message"}
