{"nick":"kpg_","message":"is there a way to programmatically stop a expressjs listen function. I would like to have a REST call be able to shut down the server. I've found server.close() method where server is the return value of express().listen(3000, function(){...}). But it takes 2 min for that to finally close. Is there a better way to kill the server from a REST function?","date":"2015-11-03T17:51:25.754Z","type":"message"}
