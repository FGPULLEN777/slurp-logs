{"nick":"jwolfe","message":"specifically, ParseFormalParameter() has a comment mentioning GeneratorParameter. i think it makes sense for me to delete that reference in this patch that i'm doing right now. i think that would beat the alternative, which i think is to make an issue and a CL for updating comments, and then get a reviewer and land that patch and everything on its own; at that point, i think i would argue that it's not worth it anymore.","date":"2016-06-23T00:01:29.344Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"aklein","message":"it's hard to get any kind of consensus about stuff like this, but my general feeling is always to scope changes as tightly as possible. so if you're not actually touching some function, changing a comment in there would be weird.","date":"2016-06-23T00:30:57.999Z","type":"message"}
