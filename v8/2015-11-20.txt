{"nick":"caitp","message":"yes, the \"don't rewrite this\" could live there rather than in the rewrite-all-these-assignments thing","date":"2015-11-20T20:34:23.408Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"aklein","message":"but from reading the code the current structure is surprising (and as I noted, makes full-codegen look broken, in the we only visit the target and drop the value on the floor)","date":"2015-11-20T20:45:59.746Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"caitp","message":"I'm just not sure what the difference is, really --- in either case, you still have to mark some part of the Assignment as rewritten and avoid doing any of the normal Assignment work","date":"2015-11-20T20:47:30.151Z","type":"message"}
