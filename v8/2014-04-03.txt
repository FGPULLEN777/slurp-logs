{"nick":"cjm_","message":"Hi Folks, The DOM is an obvious API, but I think there are other calls that JavaScript can make.  For example, jplayer is an audio/video player, and I can't see how it presents the audio track to be played.  Somehow, JavaScript must make a call to, say V8, in the Chrome case, which is the functional equivalent of \"write\" to the system speakers, proxied through the browser.  Where can I find out about what library calls are available to JavaScript that is NOT DOM?","date":"2014-04-03T19:40:30.143Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"cjm_","message":"jochen__, Thanks.  I'm not sure what I seek.  I have the observation that I can play audio in the browser, and this does not appear to be a DOM thing.  So, I have the question, how is this accomplished.  I will read your reference, with thanks.","date":"2014-04-03T20:07:20.040Z","type":"message"}
