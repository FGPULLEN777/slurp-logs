{"nick":"aklein","message":"caitp: it seems like each person who looks at your async functions -> BytecodeGenerator patch starts not understanding where this is going. like yesterday when I wasn't clear why the fix for async functions in the parser wouldn't fit with your plan for async generators. if you could sketch out the plan in the doc I think it'd help folks","date":"2017-01-31T22:36:00.270Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"It's not clear what's hard to follow about it, it follows a precedent that's already there, it's imperative and thus easier to understand, more concise than a bunch of AST nodes, it avoids adding things to the AST which requires touching stuff all over the codebase to add new AST visitors, it's been shown to work better in other impls (eg WebKit), and it arguably generates objectively better bytecode","date":"2017-01-31T22:38:25.078Z","type":"message"}
