{"nick":"xaxxon","message":"plutoniix, thefourtheye anyone have any idea why when I register a named property handler, when I do a set, why it would call either the query or (if there is no query) a getter callback instead of a setter?   I can't repro it with simplfied code, either.   The only thing I see is the one that works does a keyed store and the one that doesn't isn't a keyed store.   Thank you.","date":"2016-10-31T07:22:32.018Z","type":"message"}
