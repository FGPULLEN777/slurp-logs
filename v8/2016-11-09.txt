{"nick":"aklein","message":"caitp: but I'll ask anyway and provide my answer. why are all the new iterator Maps stored on the native context rather than on the Heap? my guess is that since they're maps of JS Objects, so they have context-specific stuff (like prototypes) linked from them","date":"2016-11-09T20:09:17.940Z","type":"message"}
