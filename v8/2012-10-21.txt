{"nick":"sanjoyd","message":"Yeah, it seemed to me that you won't be able to do things like representation changes and other OOP things nicely in a tracing JIT.","date":"2012-10-21T11:41:09.260Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"sanjoyd","message":"Like a value might be 31 bit integral in a specific trace, but all the trace exits will have to box it back, which may not have been necessary.","date":"2012-10-21T11:41:54.125Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph","message":"sanjoyd: I guess if you have a hot side exit you will trace from it and then you can eliminate a boxing on the border between traces when you connect them.

{"nick":"mraleph","message":"should be pretty easy.","date":"2012-10-21T11:45:58.938Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"sanjoyd","message":"mraleph: yeah, LJ2 does something like that in eliminating unneeded lua-stack operations.  But we still have to wait for the side trace to get hot even when we have the info required to propagate the integer representation further.","date":"2012-10-21T11:48:49.232Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"sanjoyd","message":"I guess the central point is that a tracing JIT only sees a single trace, while a method JIT has the whole CFG to infer from.","date":"2012-10-21T11:49:45.911Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph","message":"sanjoyd: well, yes. but it does not waste time propagating information from places that do not matter and neither does information from the cold places obscure the inference.","date":"2012-10-21T12:08:12.872Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph","message":"sanjoyd: in method jit you would have to assign weights to loops somehow to drive inference right way in complex cases.","date":"2012-10-21T12:08:46.453Z","type":"message"}
