{"nick":"unixpickle","message":"Jarvix: wow, sorry for the 4 hour delay; anyways, yeah i'm trying to get V8 to run on a custom-built OS, and I'm already implementing pieces of libstdc++ on my own, but I was just wondering if anybody has done something like that before","date":"2014-04-22T00:15:36.421Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Jarvix","message":"Hobby OS?","date":"2014-04-22T00:15:58.906Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"unixpickle","message":"yup","date":"2014-04-22T00:16:05.089Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Jarvix","message":"nice. I hope you are in usermode tho lol","date":"2014-04-22T00:16:17.417Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Jarvix","message":"Anyways, make sure you have POSIX running (newlib or so). And indeed get libstdc++. I dont know if V8 uses it tho (try compiling without?)","date":"2014-04-22T00:17:08.221Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"unixpickle","message":"V8 uses libstdc++ a ton; what I have been doing is building without any standard library, and adding the libstdc++ headers and declarations as I get errors building in order to trace out exactly what V8 needs","date":"2014-04-22T00:17:58.438Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"unixpickle","message":"I have a subset of posix setup, but I want to keep my standard library lightweight--the entire goal of the OS is to have *every* application running under a V8 VM in javascript","date":"2014-04-22T00:18:50.272Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Jarvix","message":"maybe try it the othe way around then?","date":"2014-04-22T00:23:28.981Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Jarvix","message":"get a full scale libc and libstdc++, make it work (not easy), and go strip stuff","date":"2014-04-22T00:23:48.005Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"unixpickle","message":"Jarvix: yeah, obviously that is actually harder, but it will probably be my last resort","date":"2014-04-22T00:24:47.846Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Jarvix","message":"all i know for newlib it to get the crt0 working. Now I know C++ is a PITA, but eh, isnt a whole Hobby OS? (I tried, many times, didnt get far)","date":"2014-04-22T00:25:47.846Z","type":"message"}
