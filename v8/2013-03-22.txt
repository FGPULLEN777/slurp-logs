{"nick":"luite","message":"ok, and is there a limit in the number of properties that are stored directly in an object? (spidermonkey guys told me that they store them in a separate heap-allocated array if you have more than 12 or so)","date":"2013-03-22T01:39:14.777Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"there is a limit. but it is much higher than 12.","date":"2013-03-22T01:40:29.045Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"however everything depends on how you construct object.","date":"2013-03-22T01:40:43.843Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"then I'd say you can have around 253 in object. ","date":"2013-03-22T01:42:01.005Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"luite","message":"oh quite spacious :)","date":"2013-03-22T01:42:12.177Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"but that requires checking.","date":"2013-03-22T01:42:15.673Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"well, with object literal you always know how much precisely you needâ€¦ so there is no reason to move them out prematurely.","date":"2013-03-22T01:42:48.586Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"luite","message":"yeah i notice that they're faster than constructor functions with larger objects. i kind of expected it to detect long sequences of this.x = y; and generate the same code","date":"2013-03-22T01:43:44.363Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"though I don't see it.","date":"2013-03-22T01:47:17.595Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"so it is a bit strange that constructor is slower","date":"2013-03-22T01:47:46.283Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"luite","message":"oh maybe i should retest. a constructor would probably make my code a bit shorter","date":"2013-03-22T01:47:52.530Z","type":"message"}
