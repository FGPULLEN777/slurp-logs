{"nick":"t4nk266","message":"hey sorry if this is a super noob question but just wondering, what are the ideal use cases for converting js logic to v8 for a performance boost? Would it be array operations for large static type data? or are there a wider variety of use cases for performance improvement in comparison to js?","date":"2016-10-26T01:08:18.049Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"t4nk266","message":"seems like native node modules where js objects have to be passed back to c++ actually deal with a performance hit. Is this correct? If so does it have to do with type conversions/overhead of data type?","date":"2016-10-26T01:10:53.584Z","type":"message"}
