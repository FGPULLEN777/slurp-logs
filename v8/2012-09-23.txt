{"nick":"mraleph","message":"luite: overhead in memory will be around 6 words. in instructions hard to say without counting. also depends on the way you allocate.  (allocation in new space is just a pointer bumping) but you additionally need to initialize the object (all 10 words), plus there might be some small overhead to reach allocation stub in the first place if you do like new Array(4).","date":"2012-09-23T12:57:12.968Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mraleph","message":"luite: reclamation always costs nothing for young objects, and pretty cheap for old objects… however if it survives one minor GC it will be copied, if it survives two it will be promoted — both times you pay something for copying and scanning.
