{"nick":"marja___","message":"behelit: humm, yea, so, a handlescope needs to be there when you create the first handle..","date":"2014-03-21T15:13:50.356Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"marja___","message":"behelit: so it depends what you're trying to do","date":"2014-03-21T15:15:14.343Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"marja___","message":"so you shouldn't do like: create a handlescope and then have a loop which creates zillion handles","date":"2014-03-21T15:15:55.838Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"marja___","message":"like, have a func which checks if the next script should run in the same context, if not, then return, and then caller then calls it again, or something like that.","date":"2014-03-21T15:22:36.174Z","type":"message"}
