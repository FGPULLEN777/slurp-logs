{"nick":"aklein","message":"pinepain: oh, I meant to respond to your thing about GetIdentityHash. Yes, it's indeed not unique, but that doesn't keep it from being useful as a hash. in C++, at least, using unordered_map, I use pointer identity as the equality function along with GetIdentityHash as the hash","date":"2017-02-18T00:00:37.377Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pinepain","message":"aklein: Yeah, I saw that in d8 and mimic to experiment with modules, got collision at 23k or so modules once, but can't reproduce after that","date":"2017-02-18T00:05:52.934Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"aklein","message":"pinepain: not sure what you're saying, collisions are expected in most hash tables, that's why they use both a hash function and an equality function","date":"2017-02-18T00:07:53.238Z","type":"message"}
