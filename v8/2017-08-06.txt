{"nick":"caitp","message":"dsamarin: if the object is null/undefined (at least in near-ToT v8), it should throw an exception","date":"2017-08-06T03:40:02.366Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"so you'd probably need to wrap that in a TryCatch","date":"2017-08-06T03:40:30.940Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dsamarin","message":"Thanks caitp, in my case I'm okay with it throwing an exception, so I just return false","date":"2017-08-06T03:41:46.772Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dsamarin","message":"I have a bool ParseSockaddrFromObject(Isolate *, Local<Value>, sockaddr_storage *, size_t*); which takes an incoming object { port: 12346, family: 'IPv4', address: '127.0.0.1' } and populates the sockaddr stucture","date":"2017-08-06T03:42:44.222Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dsamarin","message":"I'm happy, looks like if (!value->ToObject(context).ToLocal(&object)) { return false; } works great!","date":"2017-08-06T03:44:23.161Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"If the exception does become a problem, you could avoid it using Value::IsNullOrUndefined(), which looks pretty convenient","date":"2017-08-06T03:44:53.405Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp","message":"probably see performance increase in cases that run into that too","date":"2017-08-06T03:45:04.254Z","type":"message"}
