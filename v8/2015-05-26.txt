{"nick":"caitp-","message":"the set_mode() method of Variable is still in the CL even though it's not used right now --- but setting the mode to lexical is one thing","date":"2015-05-26T18:38:49.324Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp-","message":"the problem is, it's not as simple as just setting the mode, it makes allocation a lot more complicated","date":"2015-05-26T18:39:07.179Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp-","message":"so I think just redeclaring it is the simplest fix","date":"2015-05-26T18:39:18.125Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"aklein","message":"caitp-: I was thinking of a different approach as I read through this code. is there any reason we actually need to create the Variable at all in ParseFormalParameter?","date":"2015-05-26T18:39:46.916Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"caitp-","message":"aklein, arv: yes, I think right now it's about as simple as it can be, for the subset of the feature that andreas wanted","date":"2015-05-26T19:04:28.429Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"caitp-","message":"so I'd rather punt the refactoring until one of the followups, since it proved to be a bit trickier","date":"2015-05-26T19:04:48.414Z","type":"message"}
