{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"Venemo_: depends on what and how you are trying to measure really, it's just that normal JS arrays are already pretty fast. ","date":"2013-08-11T10:19:29.551Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mraleph1","message":"the reason for this is that typed arrays are implemented on the embedder side (in browser case inside Blink) so allocation has to jump back and forth and use malloc, while JS arrays are just allocated inside V8 heap, which is very fast","date":"2013-08-11T10:23:41.047Z","type":"message"}
