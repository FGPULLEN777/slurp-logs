{"nick":"shaungilchrist","message":"so I am just reading through the v8 source, specifically through the json parser. The one thing I could use clarification on is the notion of transitions. Are there any good articles or what not that touch on this?","date":"2013-06-29T06:37:57.903Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mraleph","message":"shaungilchrist: transitions are just connection between hidden classses, e.g. if you have an object that has a class with a single property { x } and you add property y to that then object will have class {x, y} and these two classes {x} and {x, y} will be connected by transition { x } --- add y --->  { x, y }","date":"2013-06-29T06:56:50.441Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"shaungilchrist","message":"aww so that is why in json-parser.h when it is creating an object it is essentially making a note of the transitions as it adds properties/values to the object?","date":"2013-06-29T06:58:03.776Z","type":"message"}
