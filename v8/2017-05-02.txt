{"nick":"littledan","message":"aklein, caitp: The idea of using do expressions was linked to Bakkot's attempt to not have to change the backends too much as he was adding class features. Something I liked about it was that it made it so that there was only one construct that introduces scopes: a block","date":"2017-05-02T03:26:23.627Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"littledan","message":"anyway, at this point nothing depends on it, and we'd probably implement class features differently at this point, so aside from this vague complexity argument (\"isn't it great that scope analysis doesn't know about classes\"), I don't see any particular harm from reverting it","date":"2017-05-02T03:28:51.023Z","type":"message"}
