{"nick":"ncthom91","message":"bradleymeck interesting... So, it might be helpful for me to flesh out the details of my idea a little bit: basically I want to do file transformation across processes, so the main process reads a bunhc of files and puts each file contents in this shared queue, then worker processes read from the queue, perform the transformation on the string, and put the result in a results queue back to the main process","date":"2015-04-28T20:41:15.227Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"sure, as long as the transformation takes up the same space that would be easy","date":"2015-04-28T20:42:03.267Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ncthom91","message":"given that extra bit of context, do you think shared mem buffers is easier, or more appropriate, than boost's mq?","date":"2015-04-28T20:43:35.851Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"well then you will need to pass the address of the shared mem between processes","date":"2015-04-28T20:43:46.860Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"i generally just serialize things, even under decent load it does fine","date":"2015-04-28T20:44:13.924Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ncthom91","message":"that's kind of why I was thinking a queue (or at least an array) might simplify things, and that involves applying a limit to the size of the file I can queue in either direction","date":"2015-04-28T20:44:45.904Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ncthom91","message":"i suppose there's the case where a worker process pops off the shared queue and errors out before queueing the result...","date":"2015-04-28T20:48:14.322Z","type":"message"}
