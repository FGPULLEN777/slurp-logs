{"nick":"joepie91","message":"ocpysh: okay, then my suggestion would be to use busboy to handle uploads - either streaming them directly into S3 if the validation succeeds, or storing them to disk if it doesn't - then if the validation fails, retaining the ID/path of the temporarily-stored file and inserting that into the next render of the form as a hidden input; then if a hidden input with a file path is specified rather than an upload directly, stream that file into S3","date":"2017-03-11T14:43:10.348Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"ocpysh: of course, you should be careful not to allow the user to specify *any* filesystem path in the hidden form field, since that could lead to disclosure of private information by an attacker, so the easiest solution is to just give each upload a random UUID as a filename and only accept a UUID in the hidden form field","date":"2017-03-11T14:44:44.489Z","type":"message"}
