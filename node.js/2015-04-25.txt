{"nick":"ecmabot","message":"here4thegear: The current specification of ECMAScript doesn't define modules. Second-class modules are coming in ES6, but JS is powerful enough to encode first-class ones. Major implementations include AMD, CommonJS and Node modules (a modified CJS system). All of them can be used in any JS VM, including browsers. See also: http://robotlolita.me/2013/06/06/node-modules-to-rule-them-all.html","date":"2015-04-25T15:57:43.474Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Sorella","message":"here4thegear: neither namespaces nor modules give you reusable code, by the way. Namespaces are about code organisation, and modules are about isolating functionality so you can compose them. Reusability in JS is mostly left to functions, specially higher-order ones (like Array#map)","date":"2015-04-25T15:59:55.333Z","type":"message"}
