{"nick":"grahamsavage","message":"hey guys. currently we write very large client side applications all in js but our backend systems are a mix consisting of ruby/postgresql and mongodb... we're about to embark on a very large project (probably starting next year) which will basically consist of a heavy client app with the server side mainly used for messaging, syncing of data/files, conflict resolution etc.  What advantages have you guys noticed when moving to server-side js?
