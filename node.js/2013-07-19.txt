{"nick":"poorman","message":"I got a sick idea for anyone who wants it. Maybe it should just be part of NPM or a separate service. When updates are pushed that fix some serious problem with an npm package maybe get an email notification that the package was updated. For example I just updated jade from 0.31.2 to 0.33.0 and it shaved 6 seconds off the render time. It would have been great to know that issue had been fixed a while ago.","date":"2013-07-19T15:23:10.244Z","type":"message"}
