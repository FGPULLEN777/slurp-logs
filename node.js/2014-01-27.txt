Then setting your htdocs root to /path/to/htdocs. Enabling the options for allow override none, and options +followsymlinks. At that point it becomes a permissions issue which would lead to the CIFS share requiring the 0644 for files & 0755 for folders","date":"2014-01-27T14:13:57.217Z","type":"message"}
