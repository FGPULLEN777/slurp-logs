{"nick":"dohpaz42","message":"fruitFly: that's great. I would posit that the behavior you're seeing is not a stable approach; you are relying on titles never being modified for other purposes before the callback is called, which could change the data in subtle and unexpected ways. If you're fine with this, then that is okay. I would still strongly encourage reading up on the control flow of node and how it works. :)","date":"2013-10-21T17:15:30.469Z","type":"message"}
