{"nick":"crazyhorse","message":"so the idea is i need to sign the content with the signature .. and i need to be able to verify that with the public key","date":"2017-11-15T07:27:43.688Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"crazyhorse","message":"charmander: yeah.. just the content","date":"2017-11-15T07:27:52.734Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"crazyhorse","message":"i don't need to encrpt the content.. that can be plain text since it's going over SSL anyway.. it's just   SERVER-A signs and sends back the payload....  SERVER-B recieves the payload and needs to verify SERVER-A signed it using a public key","date":"2017-11-15T07:29:26.293Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"crazyhorse","message":"but for the web app it's going to be sending one of these on every single request.. so i'd prefer if it was short rather than 344 characters like the one thats being generated","date":"2017-11-15T07:30:16.418Z","type":"message"}
