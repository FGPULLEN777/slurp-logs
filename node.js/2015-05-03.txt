{"nick":"milos","message":"stride: yes. Thats the what were using. But this seems like a flaw in npm. Initially 'npm init' should anchor the current directory*** as a 'working directory' (which by designed it doesnt) so if anyone runs npm install --path /to/package.json (which doesnt exist) those node_modules would be installed in the working directory.
