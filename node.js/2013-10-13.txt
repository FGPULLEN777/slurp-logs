{"nick":"ericelliott","message":"owen1: oh, so you're not actually limited like that. You can run as many node processes on the same machine as you like, but the OS will do multi-tasking under the hood and steal time from the processes as-needed. That's good and bad.

{"nick":"ericelliott","message":"owen1: how many cores to choose really depends on how much resource consumption you see under strain.
