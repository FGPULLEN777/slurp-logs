{"nick":"theonefoo","message":"jazzhands: Yes, that example is straightforward, but you’d need to create the class instance in order to test an instance method. With the static method you just invoke it from the constructor function without using `new`. When you’re dealing with instance methods that operate on a lot of data, seems like it’s better to use pure functions to make that easier to test. Maybe I’m wrong though.","date":"2017-03-20T09:48:57.604Z","type":"message"}
