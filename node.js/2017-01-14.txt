{"nick":"ecmabot","message":"himanshu: While ES6 provides syntax for import/export, it currently *does nothing*, anywhere, because the loader spec is not finished ( https://github.com/whatwg/loader ). ES6 Modules are not yet a thing; they do not yet exist. !babel simply transpiles import/export to `require`, which is not guaranteed to work once the loader is finished. Use CommonJS modules for now.","date":"2017-01-14T07:13:08.626Z","type":"message"}
