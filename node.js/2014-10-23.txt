If we were talking about arrays, flatMap would be something like `flatten([1, 2, 3].map(f))`, that is, it maps, then flattens. So, if `f = (a) => [a, a + 0.5]`, then `a.map(f)` would be `[[1, 1.5], [2, 2.5], [3, 3.5]]`, and once you flatten it `[1, 1.5, 2, 2","date":"2014-10-23T18:00:45.477Z","type":"message"}
