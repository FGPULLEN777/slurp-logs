{"nick":"jaawerth","message":"plexigras: More or less, yes, except use .once instead of .on, since it its trigger only matters once and you don't want it to hang around and leak, and I'd also listen for \"error\" and reject","date":"2017-07-08T15:05:09.970Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jaawerth","message":"and to __rgn's point, usually you'd only promisify an event if you need to listen for a before/after state of some sort... the Promise only resolves once, an emitter can in theory emit any number of times","date":"2017-07-08T15:06:00.322Z","type":"message"}
