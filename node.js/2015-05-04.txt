{"nick":"ian_mac","message":"roadrunneratwast: I would say knowing JAvascript and knowing how to work in async world would give you a baseline.  But there is a lot to learn by learning from some of the frameworks available - i.e. learn the ins and outs of express.  Study the differences between the async module and promises.  Learn a bit about the common logging modules perhaps.  This would allow you to get up and going with a new team working in Node quickly.","date":"2015-05-04T15:57:17.688Z","type":"message"}
