{"nick":"joepie91","message":"cestdoe: right, but in this case my objective is to write a deobfuscator, ie. it needs to be able to handle arbitrary trickery, *especially* unintuitive things since that's what obfuscators use to mislead people trying to deobfuscate their junk :)","date":"2018-01-14T15:35:27.073Z","type":"message"}
