{"nick":"orion","message":"Hi. I am getting a single 404 error when I try to use a particular module. I checked the debugging console and it seems that the file being imported is /ng2-bootstrap/ng2-bootstrap.js rather than /node_modules/ng2-bootstrap/ng2-bootstrap.js. Does anyone know where I could begin looking to figure out why the wrong URL is being requested?","date":"2016-05-08T07:37:37.872Z","type":"message"}
