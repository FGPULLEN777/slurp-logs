{"nick":"zumba_addict","message":"another question. Am I right that it's safe to `npm link module` on a project even if it's not using it? I'm thinking it's safe before there will be no code in the app that will import it. The reason I'm planning to do this is because we have many repos and I'd like to write a script that will run npm link on all of them. That way, I don't have to guess which module I need for this webapp","date":"2016-12-17T07:16:11.286Z","type":"message"}
