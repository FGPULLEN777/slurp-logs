{"nick":"joepie91","message":"xPotatoCode: 1) in MySQL you need to use VARCHAR for most fields because TEXT fields are slow, but VARCHAR has a character limit that you need to decide upfront - PostgreSQL has no such limitation, you can just use TEXT everywhere, it's just as performant and in fact VARCHAR in PostgreSQL is just a TEXT column behind the scenes; in practice, this just means you don't need to think about what character limits to define","date":"2018-02-01T15:35:17.861Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"joepie91","message":"xPotatoCode: 2) in MySQL, for large tables a common approach is to have a table whose name is suffixed with _old or something where old, archived entries are moved, so that the main table stays fast - in PostgreSQL no such hacks are necessary, as it supports partial indexes, which give you the same benefits but without an extra table: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/indexes-partial.html","date":"2018-02-01T15:36:19.009Z","type":"message"}
