{"nick":"Lexdtv","message":"Hey all, I have what is hopefully a simple Node question but I am a little out of my depth when it comes to file streams/piping in node. I need to open a CSV file, add data to each row (it will always be in the same location, like data[5] = email) and then save the file. I have found multiple csv parsers and been able to open a csv file but I don't know how to make changes to it. Thanks!","date":"2014-11-07T21:14:33.967Z","type":"message"}
