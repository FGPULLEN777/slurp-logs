{"nick":"Sorella","message":"sadtaco: you can work with streams of changes instead of actual objects. Then you just need to fold over that stream. You get to use immutable data everywhere. The people using it just write a function like: `function(state){ return { new: state.old } }`, and you compose the functions on your fold pipeline. That's pretty much the approach Redux and Elm take.","date":"2016-03-28T13:30:41.217Z","type":"message"}
