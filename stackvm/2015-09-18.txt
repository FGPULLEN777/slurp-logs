{"nick":"tixz","message":"thanks for the advice!","date":"2015-09-18T14:09:39.516Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so your tree construction looks something like this: 1. partition points into 2 groups which are separated by some halfspace, 2. for each group recursively build a tree","date":"2015-09-18T14:09:53.592Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so maybe we can make this more interesting","date":"2015-09-18T14:10:26.453Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"what if instead of just splitting the points into k equally sized groups, we want those groups to form voronoi clusters","date":"2015-09-18T14:10:49.220Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"one way to do that is to ensure that each of these partitions is a circle","date":"2015-09-18T14:11:21.579Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"and then for each tree, you could take the center point of its bounding circle as the voronoi site generating its cluster","date":"2015-09-18T14:12:40.394Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"I think I'm a bit lost now, I'll just have to take a minute to read all this through again","date":"2015-09-18T14:13:34.243Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"I guess part of the problem here is that this is a bit underconstrained","date":"2015-09-18T14:19:35.867Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"generating k equal sized partitions is trivial by itself:  just sort and then split by quantiles","date":"2015-09-18T14:19:52.613Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"but that gives you a bunch of slabs which is maybe not what you want","date":"2015-09-18T14:20:05.681Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so the question then is what properties should a \"nicer\" partition have?","date":"2015-09-18T14:20:24.106Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"I guess a nicer partitioning is each group having a central point and members of the group being as close to this as possible, while the groups partition the available data completely","date":"2015-09-18T14:21:40.148Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"mikolalysenko: Does what I want even make sense?","date":"2015-09-18T14:23:28.492Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"That's why I started working in the knn direction, but then it hit me that I might end up with clusters that were just comprise of \"leftover\" points","date":"2015-09-18T14:24:10.389Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"tixz: ok, so here is maybe another way to do this","date":"2015-09-18T14:31:04.445Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"tixz: your input points are from a poisson distribution and so they are packed pretty densely and uniformly","date":"2015-09-18T14:31:24.611Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"mikolalysenko: Yep","date":"2015-09-18T14:31:39.522Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so what you could do is just overlay a triangle grid and then within each cell of that grid select a random point","date":"2015-09-18T14:31:40.270Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"from those, you then build a voronoi diagram","date":"2015-09-18T14:31:52.005Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"and those are your clusters","date":"2015-09-18T14:31:55.965Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"it isn't exactly going to be equal, but it should be pretty close","date":"2015-09-18T14:32:06.088Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"Arr yeah","date":"2015-09-18T14:32:06.364Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"close is good enough","date":"2015-09-18T14:32:20.442Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"that is really cheap and easy","date":"2015-09-18T14:32:27.312Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"Thank you, I'll try it out :)","date":"2015-09-18T14:33:01.498Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"you can use barycentric coordinates to get those triangle indices too","date":"2015-09-18T14:33:29.794Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"basically you can just round each point to the closest point on the triangle lattice","date":"2015-09-18T14:34:03.631Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"or: (x,y) ->  (Math.round(x), Math.round(x*1/2 + y*Math.sqrt(3)/2)","date":"2015-09-18T14:34:59.757Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so use that second tuple as the key for each bucket","date":"2015-09-18T14:35:08.939Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"then in each bucket draw a random point","date":"2015-09-18T14:35:13.914Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"use those for generating voronoi sites","date":"2015-09-18T14:35:22.414Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tixz","message":"Arr yeah","date":"2015-09-18T14:35:30.062Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"rescale x and y before hashing to adjust the fineness of the triangulation","date":"2015-09-18T14:36:42.258Z","type":"message"}
