{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"dominictarr: i haven't measured the typical block length, but they're definitely not byte aligned","date":"2013-04-14T23:46:00.453Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"there are 3 block types - stored, fixed, and dynamic -- stored is the simplest and is byte aligned after the header (it's just 0-65535 bytes)","date":"2013-04-14T23:46:36.842Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"fixed and dynamic both use huffman coding to generate output -- dynamic actually transmits the serialized huffman codes in-stream though","date":"2013-04-14T23:47:18.359Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"so, what I'm wondering, is could you just redo blocks that turned out to overlap?","date":"2013-04-14T23:47:19.318Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"i don't think there's any one-to-one between a buffer coming in representing a single block","date":"2013-04-14T23:47:48.909Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"hmm, so what is the case that generates the longest blocks? random data - or data with repitions?","date":"2013-04-14T23:49:27.237Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"this is tangentially the problem with node's zlib -- it'll give you data before it gets to the (byte aligned) 4 byte adler at the end","date":"2013-04-14T23:49:30.147Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"random data would be stored byte-aligned as a literal \"stored\" block","date":"2013-04-14T23:50:08.222Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"right - so that isn't a problem","date":"2013-04-14T23:50:42.630Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"hmm - just checking - this is the decompressor we are talking about, right?","date":"2013-04-14T23:51:29.314Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"but keep the part that didn't make sense, and try it again","date":"2013-04-14T23:53:58.846Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"ah","date":"2013-04-14T23:54:45.105Z","type":"message"}
