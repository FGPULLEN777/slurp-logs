{"nick":"mappum","message":"Cool. It sucks that they force checking for updates after 24 hours, but when it updates, but it keeps running the old code until all windows are closed. So maybe we could do something with that","date":"2016-07-04T01:09:06.387Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mappum","message":"Like make the old, trusted version check the new update before it starts running, and issues warnings or encrypts the data before the new code can access it","date":"2016-07-04T01:09:44.480Z","type":"message"}
