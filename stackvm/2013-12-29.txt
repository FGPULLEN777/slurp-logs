{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"and so you end up usually having to rewrite everything from scratch whenever you change something about how all this works or make some new combination of features","date":"2013-12-29T23:19:03.883Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"chapel","message":"I guess the problem with those, is there would need to be some convention (e.g. nodes commonjs/npm module convention)","date":"2013-12-29T23:20:22.330Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so, there are two general approaches people use","date":"2013-12-29T23:20:39.131Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chapel","message":"but not just npm, module interfaces","date":"2013-12-29T23:20:40.845Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"the first is sort of shader creator type interfaces, where users specify twiddle parameters and glue and generate custom renderers","date":"2013-12-29T23:21:04.358Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"but this is usually slow and inefficient","date":"2013-12-29T23:21:14.782Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chapel","message":"but I guess in a way they do, c/etc have imports","date":"2013-12-29T23:21:20.279Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"the second option is you write a gigantic mega shader/crazy mess and use that to do everything","date":"2013-12-29T23:21:37.564Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ralphtheninja","date":"2013-12-29T23:21:52.881Z","type":"join"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"it also isn't just c, you have code that is written in a special dsl that runs on the gpu to do the rendering logic","date":"2013-12-29T23:22:34.633Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"and all these things are tied together","date":"2013-12-29T23:22:39.240Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"eg with shadows, you need to do an extra pass to rasterize the scene so you can check for occlusion","date":"2013-12-29T23:23:48.142Z","type":"message"}
