{"nick":"Inviz_","message":"Hello! A theoretical question: Is operational transformation algorithm enough to build a reliable p2p sync system? Are there theoretical limits to what it can do? Why is OT not popular in distributed data systems, and instead they rely on consensus? I developed an OT library for arbitary JSON myself, and I just want to understand if I'm missing something. I think it's the best thing ever. But not many people do it?","date":"2017-05-26T02:10:51.775Z","type":"message"}
