{"nick":"Inviz_","message":"Hello! A theoretical question: Is operational transformation algorithm enough to build a reliable p2p sync system? Are there theoretical limits to what it can do? Why is OT not popular in distributed data systems, and instead they rely on consensus? I developed an OT library for arbitary JSON myself, and I just want to understand if I'm missing something. I think it's the best thing ever. But not many people do it?","date":"2017-05-26T02:10:51.775Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Inviz_","message":"toddself: thanks for reply. Can you please elaborate on why leader is actually needed, if all changes are guaranteed to converge, eventually? I understand that given that OT is not idempotent, I'd have to make sure everybody merges with each other only once. I also understand that it's useful to reset the operation log once in a while by releasing new \"version\" of data snapshot. However I do not see why leader is strictly necessary","date":"2017-05-26T23:39:51.717Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Inviz_","message":"I see that having a central sync server is the easiest way to guarantee data consistency with OT and the least amount of surprise when merging lots of changesets. Though still, the order of operations don't matter if they converge. We don't strictly need to enforce it","date":"2017-05-26T23:42:45.909Z","type":"message"}
