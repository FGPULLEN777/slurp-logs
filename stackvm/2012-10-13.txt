{"nick":"mike-d","message":"isaacs: thought soâ€¦ for the last month or so I've been experimenting with http request handling patterns, landed on req.end() as the reason for middleware like connect vs something like (req, res, cb) please let me know if i'm missing something","date":"2012-10-13T00:02:08.957Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mike-d","message":"isaacs: not proposing any changes, just an observation, http responses tend to be nested and/or contain some type of async code which res.end() vs a cb seems to breaks the possibility of any type of pluggable http handlers without a framework like connect","date":"2012-10-13T00:08:30.140Z","type":"message"}
