{"nick":"mbalho","message":"mikolalysenko: oh yea also apparently you can do texture atlases by combining your pngs into a single 2d <canvas> and doing new THREE.Texture(<canvas>) and then fixing your uv mapping, seems like a viable stop gap for the time being","date":"2013-03-30T22:47:08.222Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"ah, yeah","date":"2013-03-30T22:48:22.821Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mbalho","message":"mikolalysenko: ahh i see","date":"2013-03-30T22:48:51.916Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"since at texture boundaries the lod filtering is going to create ugly seams","date":"2013-03-30T22:48:59.222Z","type":"message"}
