{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"\" In 1961, Edward Lorentz discovered the butterfly effect while trying to forecast the weather. He was running a long series of computations on a computer when he decided he needed another run. Rather than do the entire run again, he decided to save some time by typing in some numbers from a previous run. Later, when he looked over the printout, he found an entirely new set of results. The results should have been the same as before.  After thinking","date":"2013-01-10T15:24:11.118Z","type":"message"}
