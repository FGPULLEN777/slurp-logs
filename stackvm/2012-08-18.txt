{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"(with no white space)","date":"2012-08-18T15:56:45.801Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"you could even apply version ranges like this","date":"2012-08-18T15:57:42.890Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"guybrush","message":"so there is no difference to the prefix-approach","date":"2012-08-18T15:58:25.271Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"this is a bit more readable","date":"2012-08-18T15:58:35.406Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"yes","date":"2012-08-18T15:58:42.977Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"also, you can still style them as you like.","date":"2012-08-18T15:58:54.072Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"hmm, although I think you'd need to add the module class to every element in the widget.","date":"2012-08-18T15:59:26.731Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"right, it would make styling modules from outside easier","date":"2012-08-18T15:59:31.887Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"but with prefix-stuff it makes sure you dont polute the \"global namespace\"","date":"2012-08-18T16:00:05.544Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"yeah, I'm looking for a pattern that is analogous to how node_modules works.","date":"2012-08-18T16:00:38.879Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"hmm, maybe expand a rule like this:","date":"2012-08-18T16:02:06.226Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"i thought about that for some time now too, and i am not sure if node_modules-way is the right way for \"style-modules\"","date":"2012-08-18T16:02:31.687Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":".WIDGET.button, .WIDGET .button { ... }","date":"2012-08-18T16:02:31.967Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"yeah. because css just doesn't support that kind of data structure.","date":"2012-08-18T16:03:13.563Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"since styling a webpage is all about global stuff","date":"2012-08-18T16:03:14.733Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"but i am not sure, having multiple css-modules now is a pain in the ass","date":"2012-08-18T16:03:41.120Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"like bootstrap jquery-ui ...","date":"2012-08-18T16:03:49.943Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"also, you normally want to style elements WITHIN a given element","date":"2012-08-18T16:03:58.970Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"where in js, a var in a closure can only effect scopes OUTSIDE of it.","date":"2012-08-18T16:04:24.137Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"var i mean.","date":"2012-08-18T16:04:57.214Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"guybrush","message":"currently i use stylus","date":"2012-08-18T16:05:30.188Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"that is kinda what we want.","date":"2012-08-18T16:05:40.432Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"guybrush","message":"and shim everything","date":"2012-08-18T16:05:47.641Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"hmm. maybe the answer it to put structural style inline.","date":"2012-08-18T16:06:06.680Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"guybrush","message":"it supports index.styl","date":"2012-08-18T16:06:56.014Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"yeah. but that is only a local require.","date":"2012-08-18T16:07:41.722Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"I want reusable components.","date":"2012-08-18T16:07:53.258Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"so it's gotta get style from node_modules","date":"2012-08-18T16:08:08.831Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"hmm, or maybe you could let modules have .css files, and you'd have some way to bundle them all into a single .css","date":"2012-08-18T16:10:23.843Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"yes i think it would be cool to have a field in the package.json where one can define the location of css","date":"2012-08-18T16:12:29.420Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"and npm install could build the css","date":"2012-08-18T16:12:41.055Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"but it would be nice to have a js-api too (alternatively)","date":"2012-08-18T16:13:15.991Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dominictarr","message":"although he wants to put them in a not npm.","date":"2012-08-18T16:14:35.679Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"and a component.js (altough thats not clear yet)","date":"2012-08-18T16:15:16.422Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"i would like to have everything in npm","date":"2012-08-18T16:15:48.716Z","type":"message"}
