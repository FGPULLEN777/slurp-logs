{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"so, the downside to treating all function calls with object parameters as \"mutative\" is that you lose the `variable` -> `value` equivalence, yes?","date":"2013-12-03T23:50:56.840Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"what you could do is maybe add a second pass that does escape analysis to prove when an object reference can effectively be treated as a value type","date":"2013-12-03T23:52:16.967Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"basically you can think of an object as a value, whose value is a reference to an object","date":"2013-12-03T23:54:09.117Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"it doesn't give you much leverage for analyzing objects compared to ordinary value type variables, but at least it lets you get started with stuff","date":"2013-12-03T23:55:20.012Z","type":"message"}
