{"nick":"akiva","message":"jfhbrook: Sorry, didn't see that due to the lack of my name mention. Wayland is basically a new approach to graphics rendering without the archaic and massive cruft that has become X11. It was experimental for quite a while, but now is quite stable to use for most people. Although, since I like tiling window managers, namely bspwm these days, support is ... lacking, to say the least. There are several other","date":"2016-12-07T01:13:39.889Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"akiva","message":"I suppose you don't like systemd ;) But, really, it's not so much like that. systemd (which in many ways I like) has sprawled to become a plethora of tools in a suite. Wayland is, by design, much less vast than X11 is. Although, you have to approach many things in new ways, because many tools depend on X, of course. There are packages that allow you to fall back to X, though.","date":"2016-12-07T01:16:29.663Z","type":"message"}

Yes, you are correct in that a lot of solutions we are used to putting into place for X, Y, and Z are now no longer suitable, but there are mostly Wayland solutions already in place. i am thinking here of simple tools like xscreensaver, xlock,","date":"2016-12-07T01:22:10.021Z","type":"message"}
