{"nick":"pfraze","message":"mhmm. I'm looking at exercise 2 - generally strong start - I'd suggest the hint with isValidRoute() might be a bit confusing, because you're employing psuedologic that doesnt include the full flow","date":"2014-03-08T23:09:36.263Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfraze","message":"whereas in the solution, the route-check returns the route handler, that part is missing from the hint. Tough not to give away too much, but possibly a stumbling block for someone thinking through it for the first time","date":"2014-03-08T23:10:35.406Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"pfraze","message":"the solution also uses the routes dependency, which is probably a good suggestion for new programmers, but hides the actual routing logic.
