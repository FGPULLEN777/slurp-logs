{"nick":"emilbayes","message":"yoshuawuyts: I've noticed that you sprinkle assertions into your code quite liberally, and I've started doing the same but I really don't know how to feel about it. To me it feels like mixing tests and proper source code, but on the other hand I like the signal effect that it has, and the added sense of security","date":"2016-07-19T01:00:02.089Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"emilbayes","message":"jfhbrook: Yes, so far I've been asserting input of functions and output of \"internal\" functions. So far I'm just thinking that everything user facing should probably return errors, while everything else is fine with assertions.
