{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so in some sense: yes, you only need half the frequencies","date":"2016-01-25T06:07:31.142Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"however to apply the convolution theorem or do most manipulation you need the whole spectrum","date":"2016-01-25T06:07:55.773Z","type":"message"}
