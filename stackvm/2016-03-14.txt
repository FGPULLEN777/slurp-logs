{"nick":"domanic","message":"so, had an idea, instead of sending the whole msg, just send a \"have\" message which only contains an id for that message ({feed,seq})","date":"2016-03-14T03:03:26.617Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"domanic","message":"then if you are the first peer to mention that msg, you'll get asked for the whole thing","date":"2016-03-14T03:03:55.644Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"domanic","message":"then you have very cheap realtime replication","date":"2016-03-14T03:06:19.611Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"domanic","message":"and, when there is a failure, the network heals very quickly: you'll get a HAVE message before that MSG, so you just ask them for that ms.","date":"2016-03-14T03:07:05.092Z","type":"message"}
