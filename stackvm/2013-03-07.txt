{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"if you are only doing component-wise operations, everything works as intended, but the problem comes when you try to do a map/reduce operation","date":"2013-03-07T14:47:22.653Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so maybe it would be better to use a string instead of a function object for the arguments","date":"2013-03-07T14:48:27.100Z","type":"message"}
