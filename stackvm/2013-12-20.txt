{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: in https://github.com/maxogden/filereader-stream i use a technique on File objects","date":"2013-12-20T22:01:35.662Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: where you can do File.slice(start, end) to get a Blob","date":"2013-12-20T22:01:49.771Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: then you can use a FileReader to read that Blob as an ArrayBuffer","date":"2013-12-20T22:02:02.557Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: otherwise if you read the whole File it creates an ArrayBuffer the size of the File","date":"2013-12-20T22:02:19.449Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: but you can just keep chunking your File into Blobs are read those individually","date":"2013-12-20T22:02:33.566Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: in Chrome I am slicing chunks of 32768 bytes and streaming them over a websocket in arraybuffer mode, and in node they arrive as 32768 byte chunks","date":"2013-12-20T22:03:11.702Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: but in FF I slice 32768 but it gives me chunks in ranges between 40000 and 41000","date":"2013-12-20T22:03:42.687Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: almost as if the FileReader implementation is fuzzy about how much it reads and returns. super weird","date":"2013-12-20T22:04:00.663Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: also in Chrome when slicing like that the general tab responsiveness is good, but in FF it gets super laggy, so it seems like their implementation is a lot less optimized","date":"2013-12-20T22:04:27.590Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ogd","message":"Domenic_: anyway my question is how should I raise awareness of this issue?","date":"2013-12-20T22:04:38.180Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Domenic_","message":"the next trick is to have a cool demo or service or something that only works in chrome because of this. (but, it should work in firefox if they fix the bug; no browser detection, of course.)","date":"2013-12-20T22:06:37.959Z","type":"message"}
