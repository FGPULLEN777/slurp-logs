{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"yeah it is a module system + ui tool kit","date":"2013-05-26T22:17:41.365Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"it does too much I think","date":"2013-05-26T22:17:45.705Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jesusabdullah","message":"like, manifests and a css framework in one thing?","date":"2013-05-26T22:17:51.551Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"also in component you have to statically specify which modules get loaded at which require point","date":"2013-05-26T22:18:27.543Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jesusabdullah","message":"How does that work?","date":"2013-05-26T22:19:27.338Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"basically component doesn't do static analysis for looking up files","date":"2013-05-26T22:19:43.585Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jesusabdullah","message":"oh, like, you manually specify the filesystem mapping in json?","date":"2013-05-26T22:19:46.949Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"so you have to list them all in your component.json","date":"2013-05-26T22:19:50.441Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"yeah","date":"2013-05-26T22:19:51.436Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"you manually specify which files you want to load when you require() stuff","date":"2013-05-26T22:20:05.069Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"you know, just you really make sure you require them or something","date":"2013-05-26T22:20:17.352Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"and so you have two files you need to edit when you are building things","date":"2013-05-26T22:20:35.778Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"this is sort of unavoidable because of the way component handles namespaces","date":"2013-05-26T22:21:32.087Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"you need to say which module comes from which namespace when you use it","date":"2013-05-26T22:21:43.816Z","type":"message"}
