{"nick":"pfrazee","message":"feross: I'm +1 but (just for perspective) I'm not as passionate for that as I am for adopting dat into the web platform. Even with web-udp, we couldnt do what we do with dat:// in userland (the full HTTPS replacement)","date":"2017-07-26T20:21:10.099Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfrazee","message":"feross: the other thing I consider a bigger challenge is arranging connections between peers. WebRTC is imperfect and doesnt perform as well as udp would for games, but its biggest weakness is signalling.

{"nick":"pfrazee","message":"feross: fragmentation is a short term problem. Eventually one of our protocols will become a standard - I think it should be Dat, but I'll go with whichever wins","date":"2017-07-26T20:24:50.880Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"pfrazee","message":"feross: I'd also point out that our installable web apps spec improves the overall security story of the web platform, and makes things like web udp more feasible (https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/wiki/Installable-Web-Applications)","date":"2017-07-26T20:28:00.298Z","type":"message"}
