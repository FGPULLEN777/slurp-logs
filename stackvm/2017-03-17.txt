{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: and i think the only viable thing would be have a core with NO js apis in there except for the require function","date":"2017-03-17T10:38:36.871Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: but have the require function be able to pick the right native module if a series of builds are available for a module.","date":"2017-03-17T10:39:35.630Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: oh and the small-core should include a native api + libuv (only available through native code)","date":"2017-03-17T10:40:11.713Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"then userland could easily implement their own fs, etc and no compilation should be nessesary on runtime cause we'd just ship native modules with builds for all \"popular\" platforms (linux, macos, etc)","date":"2017-03-17T10:42:02.488Z","type":"message"}
