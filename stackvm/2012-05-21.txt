{"nick":"tanepiper","message":"cool cool - yea i had a play with fleet, very nice :)  Although didn't look at it in anger yet, had to get talk stuff prepped and finish off stuff for work last week.","date":"2012-05-21T15:09:44.890Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tanepiper","message":"so I was going to ask, is airport just a wrapper around dnode (i.e. can I do air({ foo: function() {} }, function(remote, connection) { this.bar = function() {}; }).listen('boop') ) ? - the reason I asked is I tried to do the 'static' methods but didn't seem to work for me?","date":"2012-05-21T15:11:38.612Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tanepiper","message":"hmm i think my disconnect fail is understanding where dnode for client-side stuff still fits in.  For example https://gist.github.com/ad53c212d491167ea544","date":"2012-05-21T15:30:23.835Z","type":"message"}
