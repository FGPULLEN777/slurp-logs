{"nick":"mikeal","message":"so, you can pipe() it to things","date":"2012-05-21T23:27:03.990Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikeal","message":"and they will all be emitted as \"dest\" after \"end\"","date":"2012-05-21T23:27:12.789Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikeal","message":"this is useful in tako in particular, i can sit on \"end\", write out to a template, then sit on \"dest\" for each stream and write out the results to it","date":"2012-05-21T23:27:40.604Z","type":"message"}
