{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"ogd, guybrush: sorry couldn't respond earlier, but the problem with passing destructured typedarrays around is that sometimes you need more than just array/shape/stride/offset","date":"2014-01-28T23:51:04.104Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"for example, suppose the underlying array is not a typed array, but some sparse storage","date":"2014-01-28T23:51:15.523Z","type":"message"}
