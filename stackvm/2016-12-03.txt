{"nick":"emilbayes","message":"It occurred to me the other day that CSS selectors are a query language / pattern matching for trees.

{"nick":"jfhbrook","message":"like I've toyed with \"just use javascript\" for that kinda thing","date":"2016-12-03T04:48:01.440Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jfhbrook","message":"and in fact I kinda did implement that, since that part of the code was javascript-as-config","date":"2016-12-03T04:48:19.198Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"emilbayes","message":"substack jfhbrook I was looking for something neat like regex for trees, like a concise DSL.
