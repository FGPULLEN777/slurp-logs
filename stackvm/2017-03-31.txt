{"nick":"jfhbrook","message":"bret: first, it *does* break sometimes, and the fact that neither of us are devops wizards makes that harder, and the fact that max is paying for it and owns the domain means it's harder to, say, migrate to a new box that used ansible from the start","date":"2017-03-31T00:39:18.551Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jfhbrook","message":"so like the ideal process would be that we set up some ansible scripts to set this up somewhere, then write the missing tests, get some code reviews, run the ansible scripts against a second box, flip the dns, kill the old box","date":"2017-03-31T00:43:12.297Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jfhbrook","message":"oh but yeah, that refactor makes it run everything in docker containers","date":"2017-03-31T00:44:36.286Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jfhbrook","message":"and the next iteration of that would be to use a sandboxing tool that's linked in the PR, to make it do \"real sandboxing\" on linux only","date":"2017-03-31T00:45:00.844Z","type":"message"}
