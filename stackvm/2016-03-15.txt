{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"there are books with lots of closed form solutions for different shapes and materials","date":"2016-03-15T20:27:00.713Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"though nowadays you can get better results faster by just building a model and running some finite element analysis on it","date":"2016-03-15T20:27:30.377Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"domanic","message":"mikolalysenko, bending plates is basically what I need, since plywood is a plate (although, with different stiffnesses by axis)","date":"2016-03-15T20:29:38.622Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"wood is actually a very complex material, and I don't know of any good models for large deformations in wooden structures","date":"2016-03-15T20:31:15.256Z","type":"message"}
