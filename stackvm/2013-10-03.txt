{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"but it doesn't work because github's markdown parser hates dataurls...","date":"2013-10-03T15:46:24.349Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tmcw","message":"yeah, and a more dynamic solution like that mathml renderer is such a kludge","date":"2013-10-03T15:46:59.614Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"dynamic rendering is probably not the right answer","date":"2013-10-03T15:47:45.857Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"the best solution I think is to just have an extra pass in the markdown parser itself that pulls out latex strings and generates some mathml/inline dataurl and puts it in the document","date":"2013-10-03T15:48:25.714Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"you could theoretically do this though: http://manuels.github.io/texlive.js/website/","date":"2013-10-03T15:51:37.616Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"which is probably more secure, but also totally crazy","date":"2013-10-03T15:51:49.021Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"as a dynamic solution texlive is pretty terrible, but if you ran it in node it might be ok as a preprocessing step for parsing markdown","date":"2013-10-03T15:52:18.919Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"I think though that is a better solution:  http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mml/","date":"2013-10-03T15:52:42.401Z","type":"message"}
