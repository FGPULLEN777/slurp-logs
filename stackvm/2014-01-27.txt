{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"well, the first thing is to figure out what it means to get networking right","date":"2014-01-27T04:47:26.825Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"guybrush","message":"it surely depends on the usecase","date":"2014-01-27T04:47:56.308Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"and then once you have that, try to analyze some existing methods or derive some new corrections","date":"2014-01-27T04:48:05.317Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"probably does","date":"2014-01-27T04:48:14.111Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"but for the sake of argument, you could try working on physics simulation","date":"2014-01-27T04:48:24.334Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"lots of work is already out there on replicating discrete data and so on, but what makes games interesting is you have lots of continuous motion","date":"2014-01-27T04:49:10.715Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"guybrush","message":"i think once there is latency it just cant completely correct on the client","date":"2014-01-27T04:49:19.671Z","type":"message"}
