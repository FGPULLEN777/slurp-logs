{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"but for the sake of argument, you could try working on physics simulation","date":"2014-01-27T04:48:24.334Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mikolalysenko","message":"lots of work is already out there on replicating discrete data and so on, but what makes games interesting is you have lots of continuous motion","date":"2014-01-27T04:49:10.715Z","type":"message"}
