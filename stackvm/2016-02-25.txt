{"nick":"noffle","message":"mafintosh: when I say binary format I'm referring to the data that makes up the final hash. if we can't agree on this then any interop is impossible, since our hashes won't agree","date":"2016-02-25T00:15:20.032Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"noffle","message":"yeah; even with differing protocols, being able to exchange compatible structures that form merkle dags with merkle links would be huge","date":"2016-02-25T00:16:41.745Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"suddenly ipfs can link to hyperlog and dat and ssb and whatever else; even if we all have different ideas about what happens on the stack from there upwards","date":"2016-02-25T00:17:10.777Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"it seems like only partially a technical problem. I suspect dat and ssb will eventually realize that structured data /w merkle links is the way to go, but it's a political problems re choosing that format and whether you want to care about compatibility","date":"2016-02-25T00:18:01.709Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"I'm pro efforts like multiaddresses and multihashes that try to define a standard format that can grow and encourages interop","date":"2016-02-25T00:18:36.543Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: only thing that worries about standardisation of everything is initial mental overhead for newcombers","date":"2016-02-25T00:24:02.301Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: understanding a protocol becomes a lot more tricky if you have to understand 10 different abstract things first","date":"2016-02-25T00:24:27.751Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"mafintosh: that makes sense. ipfs prefers to put a lot more One True Way and mental model overhead onto users than the small hyper* modules and friends","date":"2016-02-25T00:25:41.517Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: i think there is a good middle way","date":"2016-02-25T00:27:17.852Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: like in hyperlog where you added the 'hash' option","date":"2016-02-25T00:27:27.720Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"substack","message":"it seems like you can make a merkle dag using any hash if there is enough metadata in the hash string","date":"2016-02-25T00:27:39.219Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mafintosh","message":"noffle: that makes it easy to use a multihash if you want to but you don't have to understand multihash to understand hyperlog","date":"2016-02-25T00:27:58.094Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"right","date":"2016-02-25T00:28:04.383Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"noffle","message":"substack: ah you're considering much purer layers than I think ipfs is","date":"2016-02-25T00:29:18.980Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"substack","message":"you can always embed links into data, the merkle structure is implicit in the causality of hashing algorithms","date":"2016-02-25T00:29:23.809Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"substack","message":"like <a href=\"\"> links or json or whatever format you want","date":"2016-02-25T00:29:36.829Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"noffle","message":"hyperlinks do have a common scheme though, and there's value to that","date":"2016-02-25T00:30:08.158Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"the web does interop well","date":"2016-02-25T00:30:50.285Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"substack: I think at the hyperlog level it doesn't matter which hashes are at play (since you can plug them in and they have no semantic meaning other than verification & causality)","date":"2016-02-25T00:39:35.957Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"substack: I'm thinking more on applications (like swarmbot-*) that start to put retrieval semantics into the hash (resolving a magnet link hash inside a hyperlog is different than resolving a link to e.g. another hyperlog or an /ipfs/ multiaddr)","date":"2016-02-25T00:41:04.511Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"you adding a 'link' property that means \"this is a link to a magnet link\" implies a need for structured data that links to other merkle dags","date":"2016-02-25T00:42:01.111Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"I suspect this will come up more and more as people start to develop applications on top of hyper*/ipfs/ssb/etc and want to embed data structures in merkle nodes that are aware of merkle links as well","date":"2016-02-25T00:42:56.236Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"noffle","message":"so having things like e.g. path resolution of merkle links (/hyperlog/somesha1/author/name) will be important","date":"2016-02-25T00:43:25.845Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"substack","message":"noffle: I don't think so. I could just as easily add a link that isn't a magnet","date":"2016-02-25T00:53:33.566Z","type":"message"}
