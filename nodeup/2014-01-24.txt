{"nick":"Aria","message":"Well, node is very good at network layer things.","date":"2014-01-24T02:39:43.119Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"By 'socket' do you mean 'websocket' or unix socket API, as in TCP, UDP and unix-domain sockets?","date":"2014-01-24T02:40:05.277Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Aria","message":"Aha.","date":"2014-01-24T02:41:07.376Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Aria","message":"node ~always runs as a separate process; it doesn't play badly with windows services, so it's not too bad to get going on a server that'd run c#, I'd think, though deploying on Windows is not my strong suit.","date":"2014-01-24T02:42:05.022Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Websockets don't go through some firewalls very well, and don't play nice with most reverse proxies, so how your server is setup can really affect how you do things.","date":"2014-01-24T02:42:37.569Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"malvarezCL","message":"Ok, I'm thinking in a generic component to interact with the user in a realtime. At first sight a good example is when you need to alert some users about something.

{"nick":"malvarezCL","message":"Thank you Aria for your explanation ;)","date":"2014-01-24T02:46:52.757Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"You're welcome.","date":"2014-01-24T02:47:57.503Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"So you might write a simple notification relay daemon in node -- have it accept websockets for notifications to users, and an HTTP post to accept a notification from your app.","date":"2014-01-24T02:48:30.428Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"And you might want to use a layer over websockets that lets you use multiple transports, like say, primus, so you can handle all the clients whose firewalls are fail.","date":"2014-01-24T02:49:24.350Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"It'd be a simple service. Nearly stateless.","date":"2014-01-24T02:49:35.087Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Authentication is the only piece you'd have to work out -- perhaps have the app send a signed blob to the client, and have it send that as a message to authenticate.","date":"2014-01-24T02:50:12.898Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"That way the node service can be independent of the main app, sharing only a key to validate whether it's a legit client connecting (and which one it is)","date":"2014-01-24T02:50:30.683Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Or just share a token. App posts to the notifier \"user X is token Y\" and then tells the client \"Connect to the notifier, your token is Y\"","date":"2014-01-24T02:50:56.449Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Then to send a message to the user, posts to \"Send message\" something like {\"token\":\"Y\", \"message\":\"message here\"}","date":"2014-01-24T02:51:26.547Z","type":"message"}
