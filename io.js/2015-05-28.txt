{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"I agree that readable-stream use in the ecosystem is worrisome, because while you can guarantee the version of stream your package is exporting, you can't guarantee anything about the version of stream it's going to be talking to","date":"2015-05-28T07:06:33.506Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"chrisdickinson","message":"yep, though by phrasing it that way (or warning at all), it's a subtle push away from pinning on patched deps. there'll probably be a bit of pushback on that.","date":"2015-05-28T07:12:01.647Z","type":"message"}
