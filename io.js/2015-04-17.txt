{"nick":"DANtheBEASTman","message":"i mean I'm sure there aren't usually duplicates within the same project, but you'll likely have many duplicates of multiple versions of underscore or lodash across your disk, rather than one copy of each version in one place.. if it were common to include your node_modules dependencies when distributing this would make sense but it seems generally frowned upon..","date":"2015-04-17T06:38:49.551Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"semver ranges, combined with *not* including node_modules on reusable code, means npm can try to come up with the smallest possible node_modules config on install.","date":"2015-04-17T06:41:47.426Z","type":"message"}
