{"nick":"Keverw","message":"Hey :) I haven't got a chance to setup sxfs yet. I'm still specing out my app but quick question: How redundant would something like this be for writing logs or other data? I'm planning to run under Docker so this seems the simplest way for persistent disk. Like if the network is down, will it just fail to write a file like a regular disk error I guess? I'd think if I had more than 1 node it would most likely try the other nodes","date":"2016-07-10T00:35:28.542Z","type":"message"}
