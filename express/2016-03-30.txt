{"nick":"hipsterslapfight","message":"you can get an html fragment from the server and use that","date":"2016-03-30T14:26:55.111Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"hipsterslapfight","message":"you can do the whole thing in react where you're always just grabbing things and updating/removing them as necessary and changing the state of the project","date":"2016-03-30T14:27:15.588Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"hipsterslapfight","message":"you can make the entire call itself an ajax call","date":"2016-03-30T14:27:28.190Z","type":"message"}
