I am testing a simple CRUD app, I fill db with data each time server is created, then use Mocha's beforeEach to delete it and then test simple GET request. Most of the time it works but sometimes express returns the initial data even though they were delete in beforeEach. I am starting to be desperate - spent few hours on it already.
