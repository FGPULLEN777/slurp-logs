In order to do this, I set the proxypass to /subdir instead of /. In order to handle this, I wrote a function to prepend a base URL to links in Pug templates, however, I can't seem to get the routers to work right. If anybody could give me a hand, that'd be appreciated.","date":"2018-01-29T20:17:15.100Z","type":"message"}
