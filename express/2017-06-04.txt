{"nick":"zsoc","message":"The point was you aren't getting any benefit from it, and it _could_ cause issues. Just because there is only a single documented known problem doesn't mean others don't exist. It's just good code hygiene is all. If you read it and you still want to use it, that's fine I guess. It's your application :)","date":"2017-06-04T00:27:12.384Z","type":"message"}
