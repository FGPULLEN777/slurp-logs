{"nick":"subliminal_m_","message":"the problem was, im running the app on my server, not at his pc, so i wanted to spin an express/socket page so that commands orm the twitch chat can play a sfx file on a webpage he has open","date":"2015-10-02T02:38:44.610Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"subliminal_m_","message":"i already have the ability to accept messages from the chat as commands to the server, so it should just be a matter of serving a static page with the requisite sound files, and then using socket io to translate the server requests to an emitter than has a JS function to play the sound file","date":"2015-10-02T02:39:40.485Z","type":"message"}
