{"nick":"melvin_","message":"lennym, the way streaming video works is that they send a 'range' header and you return those bytes or a portion of the file to them ... they can then skip around the file much like popular video sites on the web","date":"2016-12-12T15:16:11.100Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"melvin_","message":"lennym, thing is that initially it send a range 0-  which is open ended, so it asks for as much as possible in the buffer, the server then starts streaming ... but id like to know how much the server actually pipes, if that makes sense?","date":"2016-12-12T15:19:41.960Z","type":"message"}
