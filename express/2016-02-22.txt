{"nick":"species","message":"normally, using zend framework, I would create a new controller in the controllers folder and create a view.phtml file in the views folder - and I could push that live whenever it was done without restarting apache","date":"2016-02-22T01:08:04.292Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"danneu","message":"if you migrate your state out of memory (out of process) and into a central store like redis, people can at least recover between server resets (auto-reconnect). pain in the ass though","date":"2016-02-22T01:08:28.958Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"species","message":"also, if a controller has a bug you can fix it in real time, apache picks up on the input file being newer than its compiled version and reloads","date":"2016-02-22T01:08:38.232Z","type":"message"}
