{"nick":"leporello","message":"Hi. I have a problem with post method. I'm uploading files on server and app.post is running AFTER request is completed. How can I read post parameters just after express recevied request?","date":"2015-04-08T13:49:24.929Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"hipsterslapfight","message":"it sounds like you're ending the request earlier somewhere up the chain","date":"2015-04-08T13:51:16.041Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lennym","message":"leporello: Do you mean after the request is completed or after the response has been sent?","date":"2015-04-08T13:52:08.785Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lennym","message":"The former is a side-effect of body-parser so it might be that you're using that.","date":"2015-04-08T13:52:29.332Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lennym","message":"Otherwise - what hipsterslapfight said ^","date":"2015-04-08T13:52:37.741Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"hipsterslapfight","message":"oh yeah i was assuming after response had been sent, i wouldn't see any issue with waiting for the request to be completed!","date":"2015-04-08T13:53:45.199Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"leporello","message":"hipsterslapfight, lennym, i have a parameter which i'm transmitting with post request. So i need to read it before whole request is completed.","date":"2015-04-08T13:55:16.078Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"hipsterslapfight","message":"if you need to read a parameter before you parse the body then move your parameter reading middleware up to the top","date":"2015-04-08T13:56:32.887Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"leporello","message":"hipsterslapfight, exactly. Thanks","date":"2015-04-08T13:56:49.731Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lennym","message":"I'm intrigued to know what you're doing that requires access to a parameter before body parsing?","date":"2015-04-08T13:57:13.339Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"leporello","message":"lennym, i'm complete noob. app.post is called after all that stuff and I needed to read request earlier on middleware stage.","date":"2015-04-08T13:59:15.965Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lennym","message":"Yes, I'm just interested in why you needed to","date":"2015-04-08T13:59:37.652Z","type":"message"}
