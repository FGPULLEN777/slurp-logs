{"nick":"lennym","message":"I think MVC is one of those terms, like REST, \"class\", or \"functional\" or \"object oriented\" programming that has been taken to mean things other than the strict definition.","date":"2016-05-19T12:42:04.379Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"stennowork","message":"yeah technically you can do mvc in express/sinatra too","date":"2016-05-19T12:43:05.531Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lennym","message":"In its strictest sense, I think aredridel is probably right, but taking \"MVC\" to mean something a bit wider and to represent the notion of separating different architectural concerns into data manipulation, and management of state, and representing interfaces, then it still makes a lot of sense.","date":"2016-05-19T12:43:14.430Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lennym","message":"And the exact combination of letters you funge together into an acronym isn't as important as \"each bit of your code does one thing and one thing only, and that thing is not done in other places\"","date":"2016-05-19T12:44:49.129Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"lennym","message":"stennowork: I think a lot of the issue with that is \"what is a controller?\" - to which the answer is often \"it's all the stuff that's left when you take the other things away\"","date":"2016-05-19T12:48:48.045Z","type":"message"}
