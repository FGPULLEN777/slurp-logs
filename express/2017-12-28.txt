{"nick":"krbtgt","message":"the two routes are \"sharing\" it if you bind both, IIRC; so unless your previously bound route is calling next() to hand over like middleware....","date":"2017-12-28T00:35:22.451Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"krbtgt","message":"what are you trying to do?","date":"2017-12-28T00:35:37.397Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"naiveai","message":"well, I have a bunch of routes that are all pretty similar but have slight differences, so I'm trying to create a \"base router\" with the common functionality there and then override some of the route where it's needed","date":"2017-12-28T00:36:57.061Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"krbtgt","message":"so what I guess you could do is create a router, mount routes like /get or /set onto that, then mount that onto /router","date":"2017-12-28T00:37:50.114Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"naiveai","message":"I am very new to express so this may not be the idiomatic way to do it, but I can't seem to find a good one","date":"2017-12-28T00:37:51.912Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"krbtgt","message":"so you'd have /router/get and /router/set","date":"2017-12-28T00:37:58.369Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"naiveai","message":"actually that's what I'm doing already. in each file I'm creating a router for each entity and mounting the methods on it, but the implementation of those are very similar. now that I think about it I could make a middleware that abstracts it somehow, but I'm not 100% sure how to do that","date":"2017-12-28T00:40:22.210Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"naiveai","message":"thanks for your help anyway, I'll try this out","date":"2017-12-28T00:40:36.454Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"krbtgt","message":"or you could do like /get/:param","date":"2017-12-28T00:42:02.703Z","type":"message"}
