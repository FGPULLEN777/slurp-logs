{"nick":"degva","message":"hi all, I'm using express behind a proxy (with apache) and I'm having issues with passport.js. Basically, req.isAuthenticated is always returning false. I've seen that I should set 'trust proxy' and add proxy:true on the express-session instanciation, but still I'm still having some problems. Does anybody has experienced this before?","date":"2017-11-07T00:23:04.900Z","type":"message"}
