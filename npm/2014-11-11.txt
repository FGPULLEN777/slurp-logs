{"nick":"iarna","message":"bradleymeck: So no, there isn't. Though I'd really like there to be. We were just talking about this in back channels. Long term I expect there will be a way to do that. In the nearer term, the multi-stage install branch will have a single function for fetching package metadata and that will include the shrinkwrap, and that function will be usable by other tools. Exposing that as a command isn't unreasonable.","date":"2014-11-11T22:23:42.780Z","type":"message"}
