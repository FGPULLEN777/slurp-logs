{"nick":"Aria","message":"That would depend. Usually people use it in combination with something that either moves the files into a final destination (if the modules in npm are just a bunch of plain browser javascript) or you use something like browserify or webpack to \"Build\" the app javascript file.","date":"2015-09-19T21:43:25.188Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Aria","message":"But  usually, one uses some tools. A common strategy for express apps is to have public/ inside the app be the document root.","date":"2015-09-19T21:44:21.965Z","type":"message"}
