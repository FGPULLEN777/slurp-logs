{"nick":"rahat","message":"[spoiler]: what's the problem?","date":"2017-02-08T20:21:01.724Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"[spoiler]","message":"postinstall runs stuff through babel which uses the stage-0 preset, but it's a dev dependency. So, it complains. Any ideas about that?","date":"2017-02-08T20:21:41.202Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rahat","message":"yeah you don't want to compile stuff at postinstall, that's something you can do beforehand","date":"2017-02-08T20:24:37.986Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rahat","message":"and it'll add unnecessary dependencies","date":"2017-02-08T20:25:03.768Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rahat","message":"postinstall is usually for native modules that NEED to be compiled, or for downloading large binaries like electron","date":"2017-02-08T20:25:35.776Z","type":"message"}
