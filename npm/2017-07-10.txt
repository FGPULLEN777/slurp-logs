{"nick":"ljharb","message":"realityloop: sure","date":"2017-07-10T02:40:39.031Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"realityloop: npm-shrinkwrap.json is published by default. so you'd use it in a top-level app, or in a module you wanted to lock down the dep graph on (downside: all consumers are screwed out of being able to dedupe things along compatible semver ranges)","date":"2017-07-10T02:41:19.388Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"realityloop: package-lock.json is never published, so it's appropriate to use in both modules and top-level apps","date":"2017-07-10T02:41:30.176Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"realityloop: that said, i think only apps should have lockfiles; and in an app, i'd use package-lock.json because it has better developer ergonomics","date":"2017-07-10T02:41:54.616Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"realityloop: so in that case, if all of your devs are on npm5+ for sure, you should use package-lock.json. otherwise, use npm-shrinkwrap.json and set `package-lock=false` in an `.npmrc` file.","date":"2017-07-10T03:10:05.811Z","type":"message"}
