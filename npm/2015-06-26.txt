{"nick":"Wraithan","message":"jecran: also, like tbranyen said, you probably don't actually want to bind to \"*\", you probably want to use ~ then the version of the thing you installed. --save-dev will do that for you","date":"2015-06-26T14:12:37.250Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Wraithan","message":"~1.2.3 would mean bind to >=1.2.3 and less than <2.0","date":"2015-06-26T14:13:26.554Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Wraithan","message":"I keep finding cases where I bound to * for a dev dep because \"screw it, it is a dev dep\" then the dev dep changes and breaks a test or something, then I end up not being able to use tools like git bisect (at least not without a little extra work). Ideally if you check out your code at an older commit, you should be able to run your tests and they will pass like they did in that commit","date":"2015-06-26T14:16:24.335Z","type":"message"}
