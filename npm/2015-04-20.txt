{"nick":"jaawerth","message":"Hey! I'm drawing a blank on this, but I swear it exists - yet can't find it online. Isn't there an npm command to run scripts from your project/.bin folder?","date":"2015-04-20T14:48:00.119Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Havvy","message":"npm scripts adds \"project/node_modules/.bin\" to your PATH, but it doesn't add \"project/.bin\"","date":"2015-04-20T14:48:52.851Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jaawerth","message":"ohh okay","date":"2015-04-20T14:50:31.626Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jaawerth","message":"it's simply using the scripts stuff in package.json (which I already use, but more often via aliases I think) to selectively add to bin, not add the whole bin to the path","date":"2015-04-20T14:50:56.531Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Havvy","message":"There's a few special cases where you can do `npm start` & `npm test` if x is \"start\" or \"test\".","date":"2015-04-20T14:51:08.407Z","type":"message"}
