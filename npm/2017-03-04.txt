{"nick":"kutenai","message":"perhaps the answer to that is using semver, i.e. \"react\": \"^15.*\" in the dependencies.","date":"2017-03-04T20:27:05.503Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"kutenai","message":"I have observed on several modules I've looked at \"recharts, for example\" that they export the src to the lib dir, and use babel to do this. I had been looking for a way to use webpack to do that.. but perhaps that isn't something that anyone does.","date":"2017-03-04T20:30:50.906Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"kutenai","message":"I guess I'd love to see a \"best practices\" on this subject.. is there such a document that anyone is aware of?","date":"2017-03-04T20:31:19.392Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"kutenai: and yes, always use a semver range in dependencies. but react itself is a singleton, so it should always be a peer dep in every react module in the ecosystem","date":"2017-03-04T21:00:03.563Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"kutenai","message":"So, going further, if the lower-level modules/components all specified react and friends as peerDependencies, then the top level could either specify react as a Dependency, or, react could be loaded in the browser.
