{"nick":"Aria","message":"No, because you have to link at the right place and that changes with whether there are other modules that need different versions.","date":"2015-12-21T15:35:47.856Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"L8D","message":"this would only be for local developement, to allow devs to work on everything in parallel. Otherwise, if they make a change in one package, they'd need to re-install the package and copy over the newer build","date":"2015-12-21T15:36:33.553Z","type":"message"}
