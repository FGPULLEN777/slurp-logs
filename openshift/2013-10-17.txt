We basically had a client do an HTTP request to server app, which would give server clients IP, then the client would start a local server and goto listen and the hosted server would then request a connect to client... This got around the application routing, but I dont think Nodester devs liked the solution as it by","date":"2013-10-17T14:44:06.680Z","type":"message"}
