{"nick":"jasnell","message":"for me the risk is breaking people. yes it's master, yes it's a dev image that's not supposed to have stability guarantees, but recent history has shown that there's a segment of the ecosystem that yells and screams at us if we break their stuff in master even if the current and lts branches are unaffected","date":"2016-09-12T18:37:59.696Z","type":"message"}
