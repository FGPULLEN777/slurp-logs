{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"dunno. if they don't then they aren't going to be notified when many of the events occur. i guess we'll need to ask them","date":"2017-09-05T23:17:07.570Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"ok, so, for process.nextTick() ultimately you’re interested in the performance of PushAsyncIds() … right?","date":"2017-09-05T23:18:22.754Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"that's the first place i looked b/c it's the most obvious, but it'll also have consequences on the native side as well. though there's a decent chance that the performance difference isn't enough to matter.","date":"2017-09-05T23:19:48.937Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"addaleax: what I don't understand is that SetValue() doesn't give them any insight into JS reads/writes. so they must be doing something from the VM level?","date":"2017-09-05T23:29:56.910Z","type":"message"}
