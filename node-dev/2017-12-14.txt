{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"redeclare it","date":"2017-12-14T02:52:53.842Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"because when the first statement executes x will be a const","date":"2017-12-14T02:53:46.666Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"and so the binding is declared immutable","date":"2017-12-14T02:54:05.200Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"yeah","date":"2017-12-14T02:54:09.385Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"TimothyGu","message":"So what you are saying is that we should either have all const (await or not) be immutable bindings, or all const be mutable?","date":"2017-12-14T02:58:26.405Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"neither of those really","date":"2017-12-14T03:02:33.666Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bradleymeck","message":"it gets really strange, `const x = 1;` makes a mutable global and never does lexical stuff, but `const x = 1; const x = 2;` is a syntax error, which acts like it was a real binding","date":"2017-12-14T03:05:46.267Z","type":"message"}
