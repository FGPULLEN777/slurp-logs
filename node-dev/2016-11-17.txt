{"nick":"LAZER","message":"question regarding building flamegraphs when using `--perf_basic_prof_only_functions` in Node 6: in my flamegraph I have many entries that simple say `[perf-$PID.map]`. Is this purely an artifact of the lack of other perf info, since `--perf_basic_prof_only_functions` only outputs function location info?","date":"2016-11-17T14:59:10.551Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"LAZER","message":"I haven't checked, the reason I was mostly interested in `only_functions` is then the output map file doesn't grow (since the symbols don't move)","date":"2016-11-17T15:13:10.235Z","type":"message"}
