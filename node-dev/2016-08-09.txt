{"nick":"Rantanen","message":"Looking at having a stab at https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2398 given it's not moving anywhere.","date":"2016-08-09T22:19:57.973Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Rantanen","message":"But would like to confirm the approach before having a look.","date":"2016-08-09T22:20:33.405Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Rantanen","message":"Would it be okay to implement a lightweight wrapper around the necessary openssl APIs and then doing the actual API in JavaScript? Or is this frowned upon for performance reasons, etc.?","date":"2016-08-09T22:21:15.004Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"Rantanen: without knowing much about that particular issue, yes, that sounds reasonable","date":"2016-08-09T22:29:43.009Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"if it makes you more comfortable to have more eyes on it, you can open an in-progress PR before everything’s ready","date":"2016-08-09T22:30:24.036Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Rantanen","message":"addaleax: Thanks. I'll start with that then. Always found it a bit of a cludge to inherit event evemitters, etc. from C++ code.","date":"2016-08-09T22:30:42.141Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"oh, yeah, that sounds like something for JS","date":"2016-08-09T22:31:27.038Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Rantanen","message":"Will see how the PR goes. I'm a bit afraid I'll hit something I find boring and never finish the implementation. :)","date":"2016-08-09T22:32:20.665Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"addaleax","message":"even so, that would still leave the chance for someone else to pick up your work :)","date":"2016-08-09T22:33:27.063Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Rantanen","message":"Yeah. I'll definitely publish it if I get anywhere with it. Either as a PR or then just as a fork and a link to the current DTLS discussion thread in case it's completely unusable. :)","date":"2016-08-09T22:36:27.497Z","type":"message"}
