{"nick":"Trott","message":"As I understand it, we are releasing RCs that do not have everything we intend to ship. v8 isn't up to date, or a showstopper bug is not fixed, or whatever. I would say that is *not* what is usually meant by RC.","date":"2016-04-22T22:33:55.425Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"Instead, it's \"This is getting awfully close to v6.0.0, but there will be a rc2 and rc3 pretty much guaranteed because we haven't yet landed everything we intend to ship in v6.0.0.\" At least, that's how I've been interpreting what's been happening.

{"nick":"Trott","message":"I see where you're coming from with the borderline-pedantic comment (although I disagree). It could be the case that there isn't a better term in common usage to describe what we're doing. Or at least, not a better term that doesn't have its own problems. To me, it's really closer to a \"beta\" release than a \"release candidate\".  But \"beta\" implies a much","date":"2016-04-22T22:59:38.944Z","type":"message"}
