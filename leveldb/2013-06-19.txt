{"nick":"rescrv","message":"rvagg: so I should pick a point on the X axis, and the Y2 axis shows average throughput to load X items?","date":"2013-06-19T02:14:43.993Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rvagg","message":"the other interesting thing about these benchmarks is that they are writing X items but since it's random across X there's likely a lot of writes over existing items; which is fine because that's normal db behaviour but it's certainly not putting in X *new* entries","date":"2013-06-19T02:17:48.750Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rescrv","message":"If it's not, it's worth doing the benchmark that way as you're inserting new items with high probability.  Otherwise, reporting the total number of items might allow people to understand it better.","date":"2013-06-19T02:20:54.511Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"Essentially, they want to answer the question, \"If I have N unique items to insert, how many seconds will it take?\"","date":"2013-06-19T02:21:30.947Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rvagg","message":"rescrv: nope, that's tricky without querying the store or keeping a separate tracking list which will ruin the benchmarks","date":"2013-06-19T02:23:50.475Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"rescrv: anyway, I'm a benchmark-sceptic so I'm not going to present this as some kind of absolute truth, I'm keen to try and encourage people to come up with benchmarks that suit their unique load types","date":"2013-06-19T02:24:23.693Z","type":"message"}
