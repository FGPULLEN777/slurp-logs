{"nick":"ralphtheninja[m]","message":"finnp: I use subleveldown + level","date":"2018-02-11T00:50:20.361Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ralphtheninja[m]","message":"but at the moment you can't have different encodings per sublevel","date":"2018-02-11T00:50:37.426Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ralphtheninja[m]","message":"so if you're fine with that it works well","date":"2018-02-11T00:50:50.894Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ralphtheninja[m]","message":"hmm","date":"2018-02-11T01:18:45.309Z","type":"message"}
