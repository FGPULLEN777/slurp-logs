{"nick":"catobserve","message":"If users create channels, and channels contain posts (created by the same user), would it be better to separate out channels and posts into their own sublevels, or keep them together?","date":"2015-03-10T02:11:43.766Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"catobserve","message":"For example, for users, I would create ‘users!sally’. For channels I might create ‘channels!sally!channelname’. For the posts made within that channel, would it be better to store them as ‘channels!sally!channelname!post!4’ or ‘posts!sally!channelname!4’? I’m not sure if one has a benefit over the other?","date":"2015-03-10T02:11:46.844Z","type":"message"}
