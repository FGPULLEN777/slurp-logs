{"nick":"lordofcherrypies","message":"argh maties! I am exploring the use of levelDB as a low-ram disk-basked K/V store to sit buddy-buddy next to redis which will provide it ad-hoc indexing. At this point I am considering levelUP for doing this in NodeJS. In my readings it was noted that levelDB does not work across processes. Is this a \"per open db file\" limitation, or a limitation of the binding that would impact if I were to use multiple files?","date":"2015-03-11T02:35:50.372Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"chilts_","message":"lordofcherrypies: yes, you can only open each DB in one process. You can open multiple DBs in one process, but better to partition just one with multiple tables (ie. table-prefixed records)","date":"2015-03-11T02:37:52.503Z","type":"message"}
