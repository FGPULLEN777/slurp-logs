{"nick":"rescrv","message":"eugeneware: I don't think I actually answered your second question.  I said what I thought of Raft/ZK/Paxos, but not how to use them to guarantee consistency.","date":"2013-08-08T00:08:55.599Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"In short, Paxos itself guarantees consistency.","date":"2013-08-08T00:09:05.316Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"If you run every operation through paxos, you'll have linearizability, but it'll be limited to the throughput of a single machine","date":"2013-08-08T00:09:40.507Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"You can have multiple Paxos groups, and shard across them.  A naive way would be to store some objects on one Paxos cluster, and other objects on another Paxos cluster.","date":"2013-08-08T00:10:54.909Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"A better way is to build a system that uses Paxos to manage the system metastate, and a faster protocol for keeping the data safe.","date":"2013-08-08T00:11:18.387Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"In HyperDex we use consensus to manage a mapping from data to servers and then the servers use value-dependent chaining to consistently replicate data.","date":"2013-08-08T00:11:48.895Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"The problem with this approach, of course, is that consistently replicating the configuration of the system does not guarantee the system itself is consistent.","date":"2013-08-08T00:12:16.533Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"Like I said, with HyperDex, we use VDC to ensure that the system itself is consistent","date":"2013-08-08T00:14:15.816Z","type":"message"}
