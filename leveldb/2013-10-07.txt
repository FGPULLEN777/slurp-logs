{"nick":"brycebaril","message":"mbalho: cool","date":"2013-10-07T22:01:02.780Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: basically i need to accept a stream of objects (things with keys and values, but no nested data necessarily, just 1 dimension)","date":"2013-10-07T22:01:37.931Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: so theres basically 2 ways to do it","date":"2013-10-07T22:01:54.558Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: either i get data like {'foo': 'bar'}\\n{'foo': 'baz'}","date":"2013-10-07T22:02:15.141Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: or i ask for headers up front e.g. echo \"bar\\nbaz\" | dat --headers=foo","date":"2013-10-07T22:02:49.964Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: but i would probably use multibuffers instead of \"bar\\nbaz\"","date":"2013-10-07T22:03:09.378Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"brycebaril","message":"mbalho: I think that should work.","date":"2013-10-07T22:05:23.860Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: im gonna have binary-csv support in there too so you'll be able to pipe csv rows in and dat will treat the first row as the headers automatically","date":"2013-10-07T22:06:30.261Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: i think multibuffer needs a 3/4 letter extension like csv or json","date":"2013-10-07T22:13:33.726Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"brycebaril","message":"mbalho: I was actually gonna ask if you thought you were going to save it to disk as the lead-in to just that :)","date":"2013-10-07T22:14:10.428Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"brycebaril: the api is gonna be like echo data.csv | dat --csv, or echo data.json | dat --json","date":"2013-10-07T22:15:00.243Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"brycebaril","message":"mbalho: .buff sounds cool.  `cat data.buff | dat --buff`","date":"2013-10-07T22:15:43.635Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mbalho","message":"but have --buff as a need4speed option","date":"2013-10-07T22:18:05.981Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mbalho","message":"and you can do `dat cat` to stream the current data in ldjson but maybe `dat cat --buff` to get it as a multibuffer-stream","date":"2013-10-07T22:18:39.668Z","type":"message"}
