{"nick":"SrPx","message":"Hello. Is it a good idea to have a JSON proxy on top of leveldb? What I want is, when I start my application, I load a json with its state, such as: `const state = LevelDBJSON.load(\"./appData\")`. This creates a Proxy object, state, backed by leveldb, which mimics a JSON. As I read/write to this object, it sets/gets the leveldb data.","date":"2017-06-07T19:00:09.024Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"SrPx","message":"That way, I'm able to freely work with my app's state directly, such as `state.players[3].hp = 70`, and it will automatically update on disk.","date":"2017-06-07T19:00:42.319Z","type":"message"}
