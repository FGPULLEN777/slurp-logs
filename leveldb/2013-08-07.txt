{"nick":"eugeneware","message":"how useful/scalable would that for building a distributed database architecture for guaranteeing consistency?","date":"2013-08-07T23:21:02.150Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"eugeneware: I haven't touched code with raft (I have with Paxos and Replicant), so I'm speaking just from what I've read in their paper.","date":"2013-08-07T23:21:54.902Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"The protocol is extremely similar to the one used by Zookeeper.  You have a a primary-backup system that is reconfigured using a more expensive protocol.  The more expensive protocol is where the consensus problem is addressed.","date":"2013-08-07T23:23:54.871Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"eugeneware","message":"it certainly seems quite understandable. https://github.com/coreos/etcd  which is being used for coreos is using it. Made we want for a node.js version that I could play with levelup with.","date":"2013-08-07T23:25:17.128Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"The motivation for Raft is that it is simpler than Paxos, and more easy to understand.  I think that this is a goal that sounds noble, but is extremely hard to quantify or define a success metric.  I automatically exclude polls like they use in the paper because people with little-to-no understanding often overestimate their understanding.","date":"2013-08-07T23:25:32.994Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rescrv","message":"Understandability is good for implementation and use.  I'd argue that what we mean by \"understandability\" is that the correct behavior of the program is easy to describe, enabling an implementation that meets that behavior.","date":"2013-08-07T23:28:12.751Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rescrv","message":"There's nothing wrong with this approach (I wrote Replicant and chose this approach), but it does impose a higher burden on the programmer.  For Raft/Zookeeper, the system elects a single master through which all state must pass.  Replicant decides upon a chain of nodes.","date":"2013-08-07T23:31:30.637Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rescrv","message":"When the configuration changes, you must move from the old configuration to the new one in a way that doesn't allow data to become \"corrupt\".  For Raft/ZK, this means that the new leader must have the most up-to-date copy of all data *and* every host must throw away state not recognized by the new leader.","date":"2013-08-07T23:33:24.321Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"eugeneware","message":"rescrv: That's a distinction I didn't pick up on. But yeah, they don't make any guarantees about the data, but trust the participating systems when they say that are at a particulate state.

{"nick":"rescrv","message":"This is as simple as saying that every node will do that.  In the implementation, it's likely quite complex and requires very careful bookeeping.

{"nick":"rescrv","message":"Reconfiguring a Paxos cluster is a whole different beast.  It requires that you limit the number of outstanding operations that have not yet been accepted, and introduce a special \"reconfigure\" command just beyond that limit.  There's a lot of subtlety here.","date":"2013-08-07T23:49:32.504Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"The key idea to take away is that you're using Paxos to agree on a new configuration.  The slot at which the configuration takes place is a clean barrier between the old and new views of the world.","date":"2013-08-07T23:50:16.811Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rescrv","message":"It's a lot easier to always take transitions that preserve correctness than to try to adopt bad state and later un-adopt said state.","date":"2013-08-07T23:52:49.273Z","type":"message"}
