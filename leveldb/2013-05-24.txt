{"nick":"rvagg","message":"I think tho that it's not helpful until we have a good way of properly benchmarking leveldb in Node for proper loads","date":"2013-05-24T01:11:10.721Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"and they do have a point -- leveldb isn't specifically designed for server-side environments, so there's room for tweaking","date":"2013-05-24T01:11:32.215Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"so we need to have some good benchmarks that show what plain leveldb can do and what their can do and even what plain leveldb with tweaked settings can do","date":"2013-05-24T01:11:57.879Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"but for you, it's probably not going to matter too much until we have those answers and when we do it'll just be a matter of tweaking settings or possibly just swapping for an alternative leveldown","date":"2013-05-24T01:12:34.634Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"rvagg","message":"for you as a leveldb user in node","date":"2013-05-24T01:13:12.589Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"st_luke","message":"even so, performance is pretty high on our list of concerns","date":"2013-05-24T01:14:26.508Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"well, I have a leveldown that has the basho leveldb fork in it, I could update it and release it if you wanted to have a play, but it'd only make sense if you're able to measure because standard benchmarks don't poke it where it matters","date":"2013-05-24T01:15:19.452Z","type":"message"}
