{"nick":"owen1","message":"so is leveldb (in it's current state) is for apps that i don't care about losing it's data?","date":"2015-01-03T07:39:59.274Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owen1","message":"backup is pretty common usecase.","date":"2015-01-03T07:40:23.983Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Well, you can shut down the app and back it up, or use something that instantaneously snapshots like lvm or zfs.","date":"2015-01-03T07:44:47.381Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Or you can use something like level-stream and write out a backup copy.","date":"2015-01-03T07:44:57.972Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Or you can add a logging layer on top.","date":"2015-01-03T07:45:03.756Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"leveldb, like most databases as people actually use them, doesn't require you to fsync everything.","date":"2015-01-03T07:45:24.214Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"owen1","message":"Aria: what does consistency means for leveldb (or any key/value db)","date":"2015-01-03T08:19:07.065Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owen1","message":"i know when it comes to relational db it can be some rule for a field. like 'don't allow spaces in a username field'","date":"2015-01-03T08:19:47.861Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"That order of writes is preserved, that you won't get half-written values.","date":"2015-01-03T08:19:53.372Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Aria","message":"Leveldb is damn good. Mostly you can get away with being rough with it and just copying files about. But like anything that takes non-zero time to copy, you get inconsistent data if it's busy while you do.","date":"2015-01-03T08:20:43.582Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owen1","message":"when u say 'copying files about' are u talking about another backup option which is something like \"scp -r db remotehost:db-backup\"","date":"2015-01-03T08:24:05.419Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"owen1","message":"my guess that the first 'scaling' issue http://bigboringsystem.com will be too many connection to the node server. that will require accessing leveldb from multiple node apps. i wonder if that is the usecase for multilevel-http. or maybe another approach is to have multiple instances of leveldb using level-replicate and each node process can have it's own leveldb?","date":"2015-01-03T08:38:28.278Z","type":"message"}
