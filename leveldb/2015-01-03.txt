{"nick":"owen1","message":"backup is pretty common usecase.","date":"2015-01-03T07:40:23.983Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Aria","message":"Well, you can shut down the app and back it up, or use something that instantaneously snapshots like lvm or zfs.","date":"2015-01-03T07:44:47.381Z","type":"message"}
