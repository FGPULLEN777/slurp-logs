{"nick":"yarong","message":"rvagg: I missed that one, I found level-atomic, levelplus, level-updater, level-update and now you pointed to level-mutex. It seems like lots of people take a wack at this problem and then wander away. That usually means it's much harder than it looks.","date":"2014-12-24T01:53:11.572Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"yarong","message":"rvagg: BTW, the reason I care is because I'm running into data corruption issues with PouchDB on node.js using LevelDB. I'm trying to read Pouch's leveldb.js file (where they wrap level up) and honestly, I'm not smart enough to grok it. But I think a lot of the complexity is because it has its own hacked in solution for the problem and as the data corruption strongly implies, it doesn't work.","date":"2014-12-24T01:54:28.490Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"yarong","message":"rvagg: But to be fair I have no proved that the data corruption was a result of faulty condition update logic, but it does seem likely.","date":"2014-12-24T01:55:11.122Z","type":"message"}
