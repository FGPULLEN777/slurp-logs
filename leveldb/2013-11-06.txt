{"nick":"rescrv","message":"there's other features in HyperLevelDB that make replication cheap, but they require knowing the code well enough that you'd be better looking at the code than asking me","date":"2013-11-06T15:01:47.349Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ogd","message":"rescrv: also somethign I anticipate my users wanting is a way of doing distributed map reduce, so taking one large leveldb and spinning up N nodes, sharding it N ways, doing some distributed job, then replicating results back, shutting down the N nodes, etc","date":"2013-11-06T15:06:29.264Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rescrv","message":"ogd: for the map reduce, it's often not efficient to fan the data over the network from one source.  If the data is small,you can just compute locally.  If the data is large, you spend more time shipping it than computing on it.  If you're doing that you probably want to always keep it sharded","date":"2013-11-06T15:11:06.083Z","type":"message"}
