{"nick":"rvagg","message":"Trott, joaocgreis, aqrln: I can't explain the slowness but I'm pretty sure it's either network or NFS related, possibly both. I'll try some things out today to try and give them a kick, maybe switch some cables in case it's a routing problem. I have some new pro gear coming soon for my home network that _may_ help, but at this stage I just don't know!
