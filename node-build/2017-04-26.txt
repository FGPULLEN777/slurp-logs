{"nick":"joaocgreis","message":"Trott: we don't have vs2015 installed on any win2008 machine, so I had to put together a fanned job. I think I got it right: https://ci.nodejs.org/view/All/job/reis-stress-single-test-windows-fanned/1/  . Feel free to use that job. I don't plan to clean it and make it a `node-` job unless you think it'd be good to have for the future.","date":"2017-04-26T00:36:29.991Z","type":"message"}
