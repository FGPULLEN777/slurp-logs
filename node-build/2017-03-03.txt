{"nick":"Trott","message":"Hmmmm....running manually, it's crawling along, just REALLY SLOWLY. Maybe once it's done, subsequent git fetch operations will be much faster.....","date":"2017-03-03T00:23:30.474Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"Things are crawling along, but almost done. After they finish (in another minute or two, I hope), I'll kick off two plinux test-commit jobs so that all four hosts get exercised. Hopefully all green.
