{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"Basically the idea is to have all the non-standard build types in one job, so it runs all the options. IIRC all collaborators have edit and run access.","date":"2017-11-03T21:23:55.725Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"doc-only doesn't have to live there, but it is a normal job that can run a make target, which should be all you need","date":"2017-11-03T21:24:24.370Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"Maybe a separate job would be better, IDK","date":"2017-11-03T21:24:33.852Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"refack","message":"Then I need to matrix it in https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-alternative-build-configs/","date":"2017-11-03T21:24:37.268Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"That seems like the same job with a different name. I was hoping one multi-config for all the options...","date":"2017-11-03T21:25:23.364Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"refack","message":"Yes, but we want it for all platforms","date":"2017-11-03T21:26:26.480Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"For doc-test?","date":"2017-11-03T21:26:46.442Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"refack","message":"No, for alternative-build-configs","date":"2017-11-03T21:27:01.394Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"refack","message":"For Joyee, maybe also clone the pipeline job","date":"2017-11-03T21:27:45.439Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"Jenkins 2.0 is all about pipelines, which is a massive improvement over \"everything is checkboxes in the Jenkins UI\"","date":"2017-11-03T21:30:44.476Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"But fundamentally it's about defining shell/CMD scripts that run on slaves, Jenkins ssh's in and runs commands in a \"$WORKSPACE\"","date":"2017-11-03T21:31:16.978Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"I recommend setting one up with docker and playing around with it, it's a lot easier to understand stuff when you have admin (and don't have to worry about destroying stuff)","date":"2017-11-03T21:31:46.118Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"gibfahn","message":"Would be happy to walk you though anything if it'd be helpful, we use Jenkins a lot internally, it's kinda the bane of my existence :)","date":"2017-11-03T21:32:17.062Z","type":"message"}
