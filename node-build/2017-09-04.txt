{"nick":"Trott","message":"On Windows, whether successful or failing, tests always generate this error in CI. (It doesn't cause the test suite to fail, so it's not an emergency, but maybe someone wants to fix it? Seems like the type of thing refack likes to dig into.)","date":"2017-09-04T14:21:54.499Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"The part that recurs is that last line: `mv: cannot stat '../cctest.tap': No such file or directory` Since the line before contains info about the build, it varies.
