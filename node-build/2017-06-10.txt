{"nick":"rvagg","message":"mhdawson_, jbergstroem: I've switched out ubuntu1404-arm64 for centos7-arm64 in ci-release. I made a v8.1.0 binary with it and used objdump to compare libc symbols and they are identical in both, highest is GLIBC_2.17 and GLIBCXX_3.4.18 in both","date":"2017-06-10T06:28:35.623Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"mhdawson_, jbergstroem: I've test the centos7 on ubuntu1404 and it runs perfectly, even including compiling addons (my test case is `curl https://deb.nodesource.com/test | bash -` which covers the basics).","date":"2017-06-10T06:29:56.066Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"mhdawson_, jbergstroem: Given how clean this is I'm not sure we need to even notify anyone that anything has changed. Do you think that's fair or should we be giving a heads up to @nodejs/release or even @nodejs/collaborators just in case something does come up? I'm thinking that we can avoid the noise and confusion for everyone on this.","date":"2017-06-10T06:30:39.976Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"also, I've shuffled the labels for the odroid c2's to ubuntu1604-arm64_odroid_c2 so the ubuntu1604-arm64 label is used for these new boxes, so now in node-test-commit-arm runs both the c2's and these new packet.net machines, and they work OK (one timeout in tests so I've decreased JOBS a tiny bit and will have to monitor)","date":"2017-06-10T06:31:58.026Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rvagg","message":"basically, I could turn off the xgene's here in my garage and we'd be üëç, except for the fact that I'm using one as a jump host and one as an ssd nfs master, but I'm thinking about throwing in an an Intel NUC I have laying around unused to do all of that management stuff on my network anyway","date":"2017-06-10T06:33:36.202Z","type":"message"}
