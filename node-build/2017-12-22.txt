{"nick":"rvagg","message":"something's really funky with that output, test_constructor is mixed up with 08_void_atexitcallback_args in the napi addon tests, not sure if that's a hint of the problem or a facet of `make -j`","date":"2017-12-22T00:33:26.729Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Trott","message":"rvagg: I went through all the node-test-commit-linux failures on debian8-x86 that we still have on Jenkins and couldn't find another failure like that one.

{"nick":"rvagg","message":"Trott my guess is that it's timing related, probably showing up on the faster machines so it's likely to be on multiple Linuxes","date":"2017-12-22T00:47:25.499Z","type":"message"}
