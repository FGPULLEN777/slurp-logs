Jenkins in ci-release was completely stuck because two windows machines did not come back online after a reboot, the configurations were still pending to run but the jobs they belong to had been aborted. Canceled all those runs, cleared the queue, seems to have worked. Nightlies should build tonight, chakcracore already did.","date":"2017-08-24T13:30:02.698Z","type":"message"}
