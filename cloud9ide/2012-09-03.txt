{"nick":"wibuni","message":"good morning guys;) could anybody tell me some things about the SSH Keys for GitHub? When i open up a project on c9 (bye cloning), the ssh key of my c9 account is getting deposited at GitHub. What now, if I do collaborative work with others? If they enter \"git push\" into console, will they push with their own key or with my key (as it is *my* workspace?)","date":"2012-09-03T07:39:32.073Z","type":"message"}
