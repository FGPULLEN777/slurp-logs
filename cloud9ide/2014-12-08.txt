{"nick":"flisboac","message":"Hi everyone, I was wondering, what's the status for c9.io's IDE regarding Ecmascript 6 support?","date":"2014-12-08T03:30:07.794Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"flisboac","message":"I recently started a project that makes use of traceur and nodejs, and I found the C9's editor complaining about the most trivial ec6 code (e.g. 'export' is an \"undeclared variable\"). I also briefly tested the same code on Ace's Kitchen sink site; it seems Ace, at least in its current version, supports a considerable amount of ec6's syntax features.","date":"2014-12-08T03:30:15.423Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"flisboac","message":"I searched stackoverflow, the c9's blog and pretty much everywhere I could to see the state of ec6's support and/or if I should explicitly change anything on the project settings to make it working. But unfortunately, I found nothing.","date":"2014-12-08T03:30:27.229Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"flisboac","message":"So, I don't know if what I'm asking for is a feature request, defect or even customer support. Could someone point me to the right direction?","date":"2014-12-08T03:30:34.695Z","type":"message"}
