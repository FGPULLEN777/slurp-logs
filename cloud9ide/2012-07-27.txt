{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"on top of this you could supply a template git repo on github or elsewhere and have them click a button to automatically import it into their cloud9 account","date":"2012-07-27T21:04:34.154Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"that's fine; could the firmware be baked into the template repo?","date":"2012-07-27T21:04:46.900Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"prophile","message":"ideally no so that we could ship updates","date":"2012-07-27T21:04:55.742Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"prophile","message":"although I guess we could engineer it so the firmware comes in a separate zip","date":"2012-07-27T21:05:06.562Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"in cloud9's terminal they just do a \"git pull origin master\"","date":"2012-07-27T21:05:58.103Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"it will never conflict","date":"2012-07-27T21:06:14.728Z","type":"message"}
