{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"i think what's happening is that by clicking the statusbar, a blur happens (hides gotoline) and then maybe the click opens it again?","date":"2012-03-14T14:07:57.418Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"ah, yes","date":"2012-03-14T14:08:16.127Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"there might also need to be some kind of guard in hide so that if it's currently hiding and hide gets called again, don't run the tween","date":"2012-03-14T14:09:07.060Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"not sure if that's possible","date":"2012-03-14T14:09:27.164Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"got it to do it","date":"2012-03-14T14:11:57.130Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"which makes me suspect timing.  i added a bunch of console.log calls and that's why i mention the tween happening a couple of times","date":"2012-03-14T14:11:57.325Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"ok :)","date":"2012-03-14T14:12:00.622Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"cool","date":"2012-03-14T14:13:21.555Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"just some polish to make it shine :)","date":"2012-03-14T14:13:34.572Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"btw break points will likely mess things up due to timing and also because of the blur listeners.  so to debug this you probably just need a whole lot of console.log statements","date":"2012-03-14T14:14:04.176Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"anyhow - i'll leave a small comment on the github issue for the sake of anyone following along but just wanted to talk to you directly to clarify","date":"2012-03-14T14:14:43.038Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"so the intention was to only keep it open when you select within it","date":"2012-03-14T14:14:51.773Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mattpardee","message":"and close it when you click outside of it","date":"2012-03-14T14:14:57.053Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"neonstalwart","message":"that makes sense","date":"2012-03-14T14:15:06.127Z","type":"message"}
