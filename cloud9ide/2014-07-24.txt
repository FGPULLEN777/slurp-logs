{"nick":"Andy80","message":"hi guys :) a quick question... I see in the docs that PostgreSQL is not supported https://docs.c9.io/setting_up_mysql.html but now that we have root access in our workspace, can I install it in my workspace so I can use it to run and test my code? How long it will be persistent? Thanks","date":"2014-07-24T15:10:32.460Z","type":"message"}
