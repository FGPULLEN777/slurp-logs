{"nick":"virmitio","message":"according to the NuGet docs, if you just specify a single simple version number (eg.  1.0.2.2), that will act as a lower bound for acceptable versions.  NuGet documents more complex version strings if you need to limit the dependency to specific versions (http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning#Specifying_Version_Ranges_in_.nuspec_Files), though I don't believe we've tested for compatibility in .autopkg files.","date":"2013-06-12T15:14:17.935Z","type":"message"}
