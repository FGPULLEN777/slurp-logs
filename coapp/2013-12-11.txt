{"nick":"Arnavion","message":"How so","date":"2013-12-11T18:59:19.463Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Arnavion","message":"I'd say utf-16 support is broken on Windows too, since every API assumes one UTF-16 char is two bytes","date":"2013-12-11T19:00:19.952Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Arnavion","message":"Atleast with UTF-8 you get non-BMP for free","date":"2013-12-11T19:00:33.467Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"Arnavion","message":"Yes, I know that utf-8 on Windows will require converting to utf-16 first","date":"2013-12-11T19:01:16.733Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"GarrettS-MSFT","message":"Well the big trouble is that UTF-8 on windows is virtually non-existant","date":"2013-12-11T19:02:33.820Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"GarrettS-MSFT","message":"without a suitable means to get it in-box I'm screwed.","date":"2013-12-11T19:04:16.601Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Arnavion","message":"So your reasoning is that since it has to ship without deps, you have to write it yourself -> you want to write utf-16 because it's easier and has native support -> everything that's not Windows will therefore also use utf-16","date":"2013-12-11T19:04:25.809Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Arnavion","message":"Is that right?","date":"2013-12-11T19:04:29.250Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"GarrettS-MSFT","message":"Near enough.","date":"2013-12-11T19:05:44.738Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"GarrettS-MSFT","message":"If I thought my template-fu was good enough I could write everything encoding-agnostic and let the compiler on the platform sort it out","date":"2013-12-11T19:06:21.051Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"GarrettS-MSFT","message":"I was playing around a while back trying to see if I could pull that off with using UTF-8 on Linux and wchar_t on Windows.","date":"2013-12-11T19:09:05.326Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"GarrettS-MSFT","message":"what really pissed me off was the std::locale stuff in VC++ doesn't seem to have any UTF-8 support.","date":"2013-12-11T19:10:32.876Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bcraig","message":"since you are using c++11, you don't need to go to boost for boost::thread or boost::regex, so it may not be that hard","date":"2013-12-11T19:15:13.340Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"bcraig","message":"Hmm, I thought winrt was all COM based.  Doesn't mean that msxml is available there though","date":"2013-12-11T19:18:58.376Z","type":"message"}
