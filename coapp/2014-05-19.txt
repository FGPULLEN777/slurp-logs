{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"hello, I have a couple of questions.","date":"2014-05-19T15:22:52.881Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"firstly, I have created a simple native nupkg that is just a statically linked library.  I'm actually using expat, packaging it for internal company use.","date":"2014-05-19T15:24:00.756Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"When 'manage nuget packages' and add it, the exe that uses the nuget package always fails to link.","date":"2014-05-19T15:24:36.076Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"toolset, and char encoding are identical","date":"2014-05-19T15:24:52.788Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"what I think is the problem is that the linkage is defaulted to 'dynamic' in the exe, despite there not being any reference to dynamic in my autopkg","date":"2014-05-19T15:25:26.795Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"I can see this if I right click on my exe, then properties -> Config properties -> Referenced Packages and then click on expat.","date":"2014-05-19T15:26:44.575Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"It says linkage 'dynamic'.","date":"2014-05-19T15:26:55.000Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"Also, I've called it 'Internal.Expat' and if I try and change the linkage to static, it complains about '.' being in the name (though works with regular nuget.org expat)","date":"2014-05-19T15:27:36.579Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"qwebirc17993","message":"so my two questions are:  1. why is the default linkage dynamic?  2.  is the '.' in names a known problem?  Thanks!","date":"2014-05-19T15:28:25.182Z","type":"message"}
