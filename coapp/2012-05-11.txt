{"nick":"ender|","message":"04:03:28 <Crescens2k> oh yea, i think i found some nice information that you could pass on to the coapp people if you want, i figured out why the windows installer service is missing the SeCreateSymbolicLink privilege and the easy way to get around it","date":"2012-05-11T06:40:47.713Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ender|","message":"04:07:29 <Crescens2k> the windows installer service has had its privileges restricted by the required privileges setting, you can change this easily enough by just adding the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege to the list in the RequiredPrivileges value under HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\msiserver","date":"2012-05-11T06:40:47.911Z","type":"message"}
