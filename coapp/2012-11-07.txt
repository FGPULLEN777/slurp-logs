{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"is it possible for a program to target a specific version of an assembly, such that later versions claiming to be compatible will not be used, and if so, how?","date":"2012-11-07T18:23:49.157Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"FearTheCowboy","message":"as to the sxs... you'd have to have the specific version in the directory of the app itself (if it's in the system SxS, it's subject to publisher policy).","date":"2012-11-07T18:25:26.577Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"FearTheCowboy","message":"That's why I'd like to see a consumer policy as well (which ... would be in the one-day SxS+)","date":"2012-11-07T18:25:48.339Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"ok, thanks","date":"2012-11-07T18:25:48.600Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"it's actually sort of convenient that it's not possible, since it means that you can install a compatible upgrade and know you don't need the previous versions","date":"2012-11-07T18:29:51.201Z","type":"message"}
