{"nick":"Brettucci","message":"Hi all. I was in here yesterday asking some questions about adding a DLL to be delay loaded in a NuGet package. I sort of got it working a little bit by using ItemDefinitionGroup.Link.DelayLoadDLLs in the targets section of the .autopkg file.

{"nick":"Brettucci","message":"Things defined in the targets section get added to the .targets file in the  main NuGet package. Is there a way to have some of them added to the .targets file in the .redist NuGet package?

{"nick":"Brettucci","message":"Also, is there a way to specify certain things for the targets section depending on the pivots? I would like to delay load different DLLs if I'm in Release or Debug for example.","date":"2013-09-12T14:05:20.631Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"virmitio","message":"the original reason for the seperation was an attempt to only require downstream software to depend on the base package if they were needing a build-time dep on the library","date":"2013-09-12T15:32:55.123Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"virmitio","message":"the new direction is for the tools to automatically divide the package into sub-packages (satellites) for each pivot combination, and the base package will only contain the relevant props and targets information for the package and handle the retrieval of any satellites actually being used by the consumer","date":"2013-09-12T15:35:15.723Z","type":"message"}
