{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"we don't have a how-to; if you're not using coapp to install your app, what you basically need to do is install the appropriate zlib-dev package, add the appropriate include + library paths to your project, add a reference to coapp's zlib dll via sxs, and make sure in your installer to install the appropriate zlib package","date":"2012-10-15T15:07:15.698Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"well, you don't really need something like coapp to statically link things, or ship your own version of a library with an application; while we do want to support those use cases, they're not the main focus","date":"2012-10-15T15:13:16.719Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"the main thing we want to support is dependencies that can be shared between applications, and updated without everyone who uses zlib having to do it themselves","date":"2012-10-15T15:14:11.560Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"XTF","message":"I know the long-term goal, but until coapp usage is widespread I can't depend on it for distributing my apps. So until that time I'd like to statically link to libs to simplify deployment.","date":"2012-10-15T15:17:47.337Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"well, we don't currently have a general solution that doesn't involve installing coapp packages for libraries","date":"2012-10-15T15:22:22.778Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"there's been talk of making coapp library packages available as nuget packages, which as I understand it would allow that, though it would be dll's shipped with your application, not static linking","date":"2012-10-15T15:22:47.130Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"well, maybe you should work on it; if you can get the libs to build, it's trivial to add them to the package, so you wouldn't have to worry about the packaging end of it","date":"2012-10-15T15:38:38.904Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"personally, I don't know the first thing about building static libs on windows in vs, so it wouldn't be easy for me","date":"2012-10-15T15:38:56.156Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"vpovirk","message":"and I think there's a define to use to get the winapi version, but really that should only be needed from something like vb6","date":"2012-10-15T15:49:07.086Z","type":"message"}
