{"nick":"madewokherd","message":"this is going to change in the near future; I'm expecting more options, including skipping coapp entirely and getting the libraries through nuget, but also there will be core changes to the packaging system and we'll have to start over with a new set of packages once that happens","date":"2012-12-10T00:00:04.164Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"madewokherd","message":"so I can't really recommend using coapp at the moment, except that maybe the forks can help you build the libraries yourself (but it seems you had no trouble with the ones you were using)","date":"2012-12-10T00:01:13.583Z","type":"message"}
