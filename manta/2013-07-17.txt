{"nick":"fooman","message":"we have a db table for the assets, to mark which ones are still in need of being updated for each customer, so that's in place, but how would you do this the most effective way? this would eventually be like 10,000 files that suddenly need to be recompiled","date":"2013-07-17T06:42:27.529Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"sure, either figure out the key in manta from your db, or use mfind, and then just give it all the keys","date":"2013-07-17T06:45:49.772Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"or","date":"2013-07-17T06:46:01.399Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"you could do it in multiple phases, where the first part of hte job maps across customers, which generates tarballs for the customer, and then queues other jobs on the tarball for the customer, which gives you a little better object framing","date":"2013-07-17T06:46:58.731Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"fooman","message":"that's a good idea","date":"2013-07-17T06:47:54.421Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"it's easy to change to that model later, while you're just starting it would be fine to just queue per each file","date":"2013-07-17T06:48:22.336Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"fooman","message":"yeah definitely. how does manta work as far as sending the multiple requests? should i wait for each task to complete or is that unnecessary as long as my queue is working properly and not duplicating jobs","date":"2013-07-17T06:49:28.876Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"it's all pretty independent, you can queue jobs as you need, and you can send as many keys to a given job as you need","date":"2013-07-17T06:50:13.542Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"fooman","message":"very cool, so i could use the api and just request 500 jobs back to back over and over until everything was processed","date":"2013-07-17T06:50:48.078Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"sure, it's quite flexible, so basically it can adapt to whatever model works for you","date":"2013-07-17T06:51:48.357Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"fooman","message":"and that would be individual api requests, right? there's no batching in place that i'm missing, correct?","date":"2013-07-17T06:52:27.367Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"fooman","message":"i meant like how some APIs (typically query-like reads and writes) allow you to send multiple requests in an array and you get an array back, with each item in the array containing the result for each item you sent -- they do it to prevent so many round trips between your app and their api","date":"2013-07-17T06:55:53.524Z","type":"message"}
