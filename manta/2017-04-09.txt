{"nick":"wizard113_","message":"Hello, if I retrieve a snaplink, how do I tell if it is still a link, or if it has converted to an object?  minfo doesn't seem to show any difference, and I haven't spotted one in the headers.","date":"2017-04-09T17:03:41.251Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jhendricks","message":"May I ask what you mean by \"converted to an object\"?","date":"2017-04-09T17:49:46.789Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jhendricks","message":"Manta snaplinks work like hard links. Creating one makes the link behave exactly like the object it points to from the start.","date":"2017-04-09T17:50:10.112Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"wizard113_","message":"ah, ok.","date":"2017-04-09T17:57:56.572Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"wizard113_","message":"What I meant was that, when I update the \"original\" object, I wanted some way to tell that the snaplink used to be associated to the updated object.  If I follow this correctly, I'd need to embed that in either the object, or in the naming scheme.","date":"2017-04-09T18:05:42.044Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jhendricks","message":"Yeah. The snaplink will point to the object it was created out forever unless you update the snaplink itself.","date":"2017-04-09T18:06:13.357Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jhendricks","message":"You could also use custom headers on the object if you wanted.","date":"2017-04-09T18:07:34.385Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"wizard113_","message":"I am using custom headers - can custom headers on the snaplink be different from the headers on the object?","date":"2017-04-09T18:08:47.820Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"wizard113_","message":"if so, that would be a route for me, but looking at my examples in minfo, I assumed they were the same header set between object and snaplink","date":"2017-04-09T18:09:20.947Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"wizard113_","message":"ok, yeah, seems like my assumption was correct, tried adding a custom header when I created a link, and the header just gets dropped","date":"2017-04-09T18:14:26.923Z","type":"message"}
