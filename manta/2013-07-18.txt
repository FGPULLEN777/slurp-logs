{"nick":"dap","message":"mpipe is always for sending data through the job's data stream (i.e., to the next phase, or as a job output).  It's kind of a side effect that if you give the object a name, we'll save it with that name and not remove it.","date":"2013-07-18T22:34:16.516Z","type":"message"}
