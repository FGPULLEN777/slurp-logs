{"nick":"nicholaswyoung","message":"I'm uploading data to Manta for audio encoding, and I wonder if there's a way to know when the encode is finished. Last I checked, the best way was to poll from my background worker, but has that method changed (for the better) recently?","date":"2014-05-17T00:19:37.578Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dap_","message":"That's what most apps do.  We've talked about having the jobs API call you back when the job's done, but that's tricky, and nobody's really seemed that excited about it anyway :)  You can do that yourself after the encoding, too.","date":"2014-05-17T00:23:21.356Z","type":"message"}
