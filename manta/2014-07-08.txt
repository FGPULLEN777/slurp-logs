{"nick":"nicholaswyoung","message":"But having manta just check the status of the file, as isaac suggested in his issue, would be a nice long-term solution","date":"2014-07-08T21:26:21.243Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"nahamu","message":"I don't know that you want to use Isaac's solution. He's uploading log files and doesn't seem to care if he gets all of it.","date":"2014-07-08T21:27:43.752Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"nahamu","message":"I take that back, it might work","date":"2014-07-08T21:28:00.906Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"nahamu","message":"rather than just print a warning, if it could let you call a particular function when that error case happens, you could reupload","date":"2014-07-08T21:28:34.064Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"nicholaswyoung","message":"I'm going to dig into this some more. But it'll probably be the end of my Node days if I can't work it out simply.","date":"2014-07-08T21:28:47.453Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"nicholaswyoung","message":"Because I don't want the user to need to care if my system has a crazy unexpected error. I should be able to rescue them from that, if at all possible.","date":"2014-07-08T21:29:21.066Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"nahamu","message":"agreed.","date":"2014-07-08T21:29:42.116Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"nahamu","message":"but currently it seems like you're trying to upload a file that isn't done being written which I think is an edge case that the Manta developers didn't forsee.","date":"2014-07-08T21:30:26.687Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"nahamu","message":"is there a way to get a stream of the file rather than land it locally on disk?","date":"2014-07-08T21:30:49.956Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"nicholaswyoung","message":"I've thought about this, and it might work, but I'm afraid of having lots of half-uploaded files in my manta bucket.","date":"2014-07-08T21:31:38.103Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"nahamu","message":"how do you know that the upload is incomplete?","date":"2014-07-08T21:31:54.708Z","type":"message"}
