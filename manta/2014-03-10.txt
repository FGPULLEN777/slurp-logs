{"nick":"bahamas10","message":"althogh i had to learn asn.1 encoding for this implementation... it may not be correct, though the tests pass","date":"2014-03-10T23:09:37.303Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mcavage","message":"asn.1 is a little esoteric, but kind of sane: it's just binary TLV (tag length value)","date":"2014-03-10T23:10:43.706Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"mcavage","message":"yeah i'm pretty sure it's the same code. And Fedor was going to do something with node-asn1 so it did DER as well.","date":"2014-03-10T23:16:08.820Z","type":"message"}
