{"nick":"dillona","message":"It seems like there are two primary things missing as far as I can tell: directories do not automatically fetch index.html and CNAMEs canâ€™t be used to point to a specific bucket/folder","date":"2016-06-28T01:34:40.863Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dillona","message":"It seems to me that manta is focused a lot more on the compute side than being a general purpose object store. Is that fair to say?","date":"2016-06-28T01:36:56.998Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"melloc","message":"I wouldn't say so. I think it's more that afaik it's the only object store that cares about doing both together.","date":"2016-06-28T01:38:26.077Z","type":"message"}
