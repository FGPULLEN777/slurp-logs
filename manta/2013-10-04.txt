{"nick":"AlainODea","message":"tjfontaine: fits back into the result caching thing I had on my blog. My brain exploded when I tried to think of how to generalize that. The searches are unlikely to have anything more than county-level geography in common from query to query.

{"nick":"AlainODea","message":"wesolows: faster provisioning and result streaming might help, but then again it seems like map-reduce is fundamentally best for batch processing. Manta makes map-reduce incredibly fast and flexible, but still not real time. Every data solution has access patterns that are a fit and those that aren't.
