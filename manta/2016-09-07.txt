{"nick":"nahamu","message":"so Manta could keep a bunch of minimalist LX branded zones running, then when a user specifies an LX based image to use, the filesystem gets cloned into place with ZFS, and the user files get mounted in with hyperlofs, and something kicks off the appropriate process.","date":"2016-09-07T14:04:35.666Z","type":"message"}
