{"nick":"nfitch","message":"Another example is how we aggregate metrics in our log files.  We have a bunch of bunyan (https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) objects, each has a time field.  We use msplit with a -j and -e to bucketize the log records to the set of reducers.  The reduce phase calculates metrics for the time periods, and a final reducer combines into an hourly summary.","date":"2013-07-16T16:24:23.013Z","type":"message"}
