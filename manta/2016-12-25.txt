{"nick":"rmustacc","message":"dillona: So if you look at that section of the docs, there are two ways to upload a file. One with an explicit content-length in advance and the other with chunked encoding.","date":"2016-12-25T04:47:19.536Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"rmustacc","message":"dillona: If you're using chunked encoding, then you need to esitimate the size for us so we have a sense of how large it is so we can properly place it. Hence why we default to 5 GiB if the header you mentioned isn't specified.","date":"2016-12-25T04:48:01.089Z","type":"message"}
