{"nick":"jen20__","message":"well, actually stream is probably not the correct term - what I'm actually looking to do is have access to it for use with e.g. mget, but in a partial state","date":"2016-12-16T19:48:40.230Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dap_","message":"in which case you'd need to pipe it to something that was sending it to some other network service you've got.  You could cobble together an \"nc\" with a \"curl\" or something to do that...but it's not trivial.","date":"2016-12-16T19:52:29.884Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dap_","message":"One reason for this is that Manta can always execute tasks multiple times (if we have internal failures), so the output is not committed until the task fully completes.","date":"2016-12-16T19:53:02.838Z","type":"message"}
