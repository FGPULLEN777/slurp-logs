{"nick":"sousoux","message":"tphillips: going well. had a question for you. Is there any reason why the module cache in require is not implemented with a weak table? This would seem to make sense. If a module is no longer required that would free up its memory.","date":"2015-09-04T14:37:43.595Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"sousoux","message":"My nodes return a function that is passed an API table. A function in the API 'registers' a node and returns the class table for that node (like :extend()).
