The nice guys at Rackspace have helping a ton to help move things along.  As far as roadmap, the current plan is still to mirror the node APIs in lua with some minor additions that make sense (like streaming json and maybe msgpack, not to mention luajit's built-in ffi)","date":"2012-05-23T14:19:24.156Z","type":"message"}
