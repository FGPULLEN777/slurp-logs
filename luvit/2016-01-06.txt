{"nick":"creationix","message":"Lua will still store a copy of the module in package.loaded at the short name (possibly overwriting a conflicting name).  But as long as my loader always comes first, I don't think that's a problem.","date":"2016-01-06T12:57:49.881Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"creationix: FWIW, you could write a small C module that took an openssl SSL_CTX* and gave output as a lua string directly","date":"2016-01-06T13:04:20.198Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"My plan was to add a couple methods to the uv_stream_t \"class\" so that any libuv stream can add tls","date":"2016-01-06T13:05:01.030Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"but yes, another idea is just write a standanlone C module that adds the missing functionality to luaossl so we can keep our current behavior","date":"2016-01-06T13:05:34.655Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"The one thing I like about our current decoupled approach is any stream can have tls added, even if it's not a real libuv stream.  It's just a question of if anyone actually does that or has reason to do that.","date":"2016-01-06T13:12:38.837Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"I mean when you integrate with libuv","date":"2016-01-06T13:15:58.099Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"like the examples you put in the luvit repo","date":"2016-01-06T13:16:16.312Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"creationix: it hooks up a cqueue with uv_loop_t or vice-versa. nothing at the socket/stream level.","date":"2016-01-06T13:16:47.280Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"so can I use your http library to make a https call using libuv for the system calls?","date":"2016-01-06T13:17:22.702Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"no. you'd use my http library; which uses the cqueues socket library; which uses the cqueues scheduler => which you hook up to a uv_loop_t (which is a singleton in luv)","date":"2016-01-06T13:18:03.885Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"ok, that makes more sense","date":"2016-01-06T13:18:23.206Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"but if I wanted to use libuv instead of the cqueues socket library for lua-http, how hard would that be?","date":"2016-01-06T13:18:40.115Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"I use a \"target state\" mechanism which cqueues caters well for. I doubt that's easy in libuv","date":"2016-01-06T13:19:35.192Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"e.g. in the cqueues socket module, you can construct a socket object which returns instantly; then call :write (before it's connected at the syscall level), and it makes sure it does everything in order","date":"2016-01-06T13:20:40.592Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"I've been very careful with luvit to keep protocol logic decoupled from the socket code.  The idea is you can reuse my http-codec with any stream","date":"2016-01-06T13:22:07.052Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"same with tls-codec (but with the aforementioned performance issues)","date":"2016-01-06T13:22:23.506Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"I don't see why targetting your interface would be hard.  Just need to keep some state in a layer above libuv.","date":"2016-01-06T13:22:59.452Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"I already do this for my coro-* interfaces","date":"2016-01-06T13:23:04.194Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"creationix: IMO that style is a bit futile; it really limits what you can do => I realised having a flexible scheduler that can be embedded anywhere was the solution to being able write easy to read code","date":"2016-01-06T13:23:20.622Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"creationix: yeah. but at that point you're basically emulating cqueues's socket module on top of libuv.....","date":"2016-01-06T13:23:53.981Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"right, which makes it slower and more complicated :)","date":"2016-01-06T13:24:14.216Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"but cqueues doesn't support IOCP in windows right?","date":"2016-01-06T13:24:26.289Z","type":"message"}
