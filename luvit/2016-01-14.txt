{"nick":"technomancy","message":"the API here is a bit awkward; you have to slurp up all the chunks before you can use the body https://github.com/technomancy/luvit-irc-activity-bot/blob/master/init.lua#L40","date":"2016-01-14T13:59:11.439Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"technomancy","message":"I can think of a number of reasons it's this way... 0) there's a simpler API that gives me the full body; it's just not used in the example apps because they're outdated or whatever or 1) luvit's philosophy is focused on efficiency over simplicity or 2) it's not that a simpler API wouldn't be good, but right now it is pretty close to the underlying libuv functionality, and the nicer high-level bits just haven't gotten written yet","date":"2016-01-14T14:00:45.438Z","type":"message"}
