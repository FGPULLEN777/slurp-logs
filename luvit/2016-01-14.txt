{"nick":"technomancy","message":"I can think of a number of reasons it's this way... 0) there's a simpler API that gives me the full body; it's just not used in the example apps because they're outdated or whatever or 1) luvit's philosophy is focused on efficiency over simplicity or 2) it's not that a simpler API wouldn't be good, but right now it is pretty close to the underlying libuv functionality, and the nicer high-level bits just haven't gotten written yet","date":"2016-01-14T14:00:45.438Z","type":"message"}
