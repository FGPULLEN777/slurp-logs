{"nick":"creationix","message":"the websocket-codec used by coro-websocket could easily be made into  that by sitting on top of luvit's node style streams I think","date":"2016-03-20T02:27:52.190Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"fair enough, but the built-ins are only there to help people migrate from node.js.  For anything new I would recommend the coroutine based stuff","date":"2016-03-20T02:29:02.394Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"SinisterRectus","message":"ah okay. i'm relatively new to async i/o programming so i'm still learning. i do see more coroutine support, so i'll look into that.","date":"2016-03-20T02:29:24.124Z","type":"message"}
