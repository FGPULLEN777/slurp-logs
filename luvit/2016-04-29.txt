{"nick":"konobi","message":"sure, but they'd be using sync underneath","date":"2016-04-29T01:26:41.811Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"konobi: well you can't just magically make things async","date":"2016-04-29T01:29:01.191Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"daurnimator","message":"konobi: well you could monkey patch various things. but most libraries already *attempt* to use nonblocking mode in a bad way","date":"2016-04-29T01:31:24.480Z","type":"message"}
