{"nick":"s_frit","message":"philips_: is there a specific project direction for luvit? i had assumed having the http/REST/SOAP stack sorted would be a first priority but this seems not the case (not that i care about http, more wondering about direction)","date":"2013-01-29T02:21:54.748Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"philips_","message":"s_frit: alot of the direction is either creationix trying out new APIs or the virgo guys getting stuff working for their agent","date":"2013-01-29T02:22:56.387Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"s_frit","message":"philips_: does it seem like creationix knows where he's heading or is it all an experiment?","date":"2013-01-29T02:25:10.129Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"philips_","message":"s_frit: AFAIK luvit is mostly a fun project for creationix and besides virgo I don't think anyone is pushing a particular direction for the project at the moment.","date":"2013-01-29T02:27:12.445Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"so the official luvit API is pretty much set.  I don't want to break things for virgo since it gets more value out of luvit than anyone else","date":"2013-01-29T03:42:35.573Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"my experiments are in userspace as modules","date":"2013-01-29T03:42:42.074Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"s_frit","message":"creationix: what are your userspace experiments focused on? i noticed some mention of gui stuff on the mailing list","date":"2013-01-29T04:08:03.104Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"two experiments","date":"2013-01-29T04:12:14.774Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"at the moment I'm creating a new language for it","date":"2013-01-29T04:12:47.624Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"also I have a web framework experiment","date":"2013-01-29T04:12:55.363Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"in lua land, I call it moonslice","date":"2013-01-29T04:13:00.954Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"in node.js it's called \"web\"","date":"2013-01-29T04:13:06.338Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"it replaces the \"http\" module and has a better interface for http handler layers","date":"2013-01-29T04:13:31.145Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"and has better streams","date":"2013-01-29T04:13:35.198Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"s_frit","message":"so that's a server thing? or intended for clients too?","date":"2013-01-29T04:14:06.773Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"s_frit","message":"the reason i ask is i'm thinking of writing some kind of client-side p2p fabric and wondering what is already done","date":"2013-01-29T04:15:44.227Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"the web'moonslice experiment is an http server for the current web","date":"2013-01-29T04:15:52.296Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"currently I'm doing a lot of p2p and crypto stuff with one of my clients, I'm sure I may experiment more there in the future","date":"2013-01-29T04:16:50.619Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"s_frit","message":"ok cool. so if i was interested in a high-performance http parser moonslice would be a better starting point than luvit \"http\" module?","date":"2013-01-29T04:17:18.612Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"for luvit, I'd say so","date":"2013-01-29T04:17:29.398Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"moonslice is about 20x faster than \"http\"","date":"2013-01-29T04:17:37.562Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"but it's also a very unstable API","date":"2013-01-29T04:17:42.456Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"and not fully implemented","date":"2013-01-29T04:17:53.087Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"though the http_parser is the same between luvit's built-in \"http\" and moonslice","date":"2013-01-29T04:18:16.042Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"s_frit","message":"actually i need SDP rather than HTTP parsing so i may need to hack something together anyway.. but knowing where to start would help","date":"2013-01-29T04:18:26.101Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"right, so luvit and moonslice use the same http parser as node.js","date":"2013-01-29T04:18:44.042Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"it's written in C and fairly strict","date":"2013-01-29T04:18:48.496Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"not sure how much it would help for SDP","date":"2013-01-29T04:18:54.103Z","type":"message"}
