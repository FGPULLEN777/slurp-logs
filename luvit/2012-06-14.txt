{"nick":"tim_smart","message":"dpiri: It works very similarly to Node.js if you have ever used that.","date":"2012-06-14T21:37:59.282Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"dpiri","message":"ok. great. how do I use relative and absolute support for require paths ? when I require a file it seems to be looking up modules directory.","date":"2012-06-14T21:41:21.978Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dpiri","message":"figure it out. when I start with an absolute path or a relative path instead of just a name, it opens the file directly. great.","date":"2012-06-14T21:43:25.978Z","type":"message"}
