{"nick":"Soni","message":"not just one webserver but actual cloud","date":"2017-03-09T22:43:09.921Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"though if you mean actual clouds, I suppose if you put a raspberry PI in a basket in a hot-air-balloon with solar power and batteries, luvit would run well there","date":"2017-03-09T22:43:57.456Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"so I did recently make a base docker image that has luvi + lit.  You could dockerize an application with that pretty easily and use kubernetes, docker-swarm or any of the newfangled docker based orchestration tools.","date":"2017-03-09T22:46:20.566Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"so for the hexes example, you simply publish your app to lit, then have a dockerfile like this one and you can deploy instances on many of the \"clouds\"","date":"2017-03-09T22:48:12.428Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"or if you don't want to publish, you can do it like this https://github.com/creationix/hexes/blob/06ef78af65e1a379a2fe63baae7fa19779b2a601/Dockerfile","date":"2017-03-09T22:48:39.670Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"but yes, you can use luvit on virtually any hosting platform","date":"2017-03-09T22:52:44.544Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"only exceptions might be things like amazon lambda where they need to explicitly add support for it. (but even then there are hacky ways to make it work anyway)","date":"2017-03-09T22:53:17.525Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"there isn't much for luvit itself to do to be cloud ready.  The docker base image I made makes anything docker based a lot easier to get started","date":"2017-03-09T22:53:44.058Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"FWIW, my definition of \"cloud\" is \"runs on someone else's computer\"","date":"2017-03-09T22:54:23.219Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"creationix","message":"but most large companies like netflix have rolled their own custom system on top of hosting providers like AWS","date":"2017-03-09T23:00:38.024Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Soni","message":"I see, neat","date":"2017-03-09T23:04:03.229Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Soni","message":"so uh I guess I should make the front end first?","date":"2017-03-09T23:06:14.136Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"creationix","message":"many of these systems are docker based, so writing the docker base-image for luvit helps when you decide to dockerize an app","date":"2017-03-09T23:06:26.079Z","type":"message"}
