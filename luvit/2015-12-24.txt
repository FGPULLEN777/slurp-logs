{"nick":"sclark39","message":"@kostco I believe the idea of that commit is to move the if statement out of the preproccesor #if/#else block... it's a coding standard thing, some places don't like doing this, some would have a greater issue with the proposed change.","date":"2015-12-24T02:57:08.767Z","type":"message"}
