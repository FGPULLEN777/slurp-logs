{"nick":"jpleau","message":"One way I saw it recently, the author has version 1.0.2, he tags it as 1.0.2, but pushed it as 1.0.2-1 to luarocks. He then pushed 1.0.2-2 to luarocks, without tagging it. Then 1.0.3 happened, he tagged it on github, and pushed 1.0.3-1 to luarocks. This is like distributions do it, but I'm not sure how its widespread in the lua/rocks world","date":"2016-07-26T02:56:14.846Z","type":"message"}
