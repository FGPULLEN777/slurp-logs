{"nick":"bertani","message":"dch: I cannot enable native erlang views in my iriscouch instance because the native_query_servers field is read-only :(","date":"2012-11-22T13:58:36.549Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dch","message":"right, I'm not sure if thats available or not; the issue is that enabling erlang views effectively gives full access to the OS as you can run any erlang function. I suspect it's not possible in a shared hosted couch environment.","date":"2012-11-22T13:59:55.712Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dch","message":"JS views are nicely sandboxed so you can't hurt yourself.","date":"2012-11-22T14:00:09.070Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bertani","message":"yep I know, however I need to use them for my project so I would like to know whether I can actually use them!","date":"2012-11-22T14:01:28.945Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"bertani","message":"dch: if I cannot use them on iriscouch then I'll need to run my own instance on aws.. and obviously I wouldn't like to stop using iriscouch :)","date":"2012-11-22T14:05:40.843Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"dch","message":"bertani: I'll chase JasonSmith on this one, but I would expect they're not available on cloudant nor iriscouch.","date":"2012-11-22T14:09:19.728Z","type":"message"}
