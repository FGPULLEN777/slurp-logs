{"nick":"tojo_","message":"I'm getting a \"point is undefined\" error when trying to run a document update handler.  It doesn't seem to matter whether I put in a bad update handler path either.

{"nick":"tojo_","message":"Oh.  Seems like it was some kind of inconsistency on the design document save state.   When I went to upload an attachment, it told me I had to save the doc first.  Which was strange because the doc was not in edit mode.  But I hit save.  And now the above problem is gone.  Excellent :)","date":"2012-05-25T05:12:35.598Z","type":"message"}
