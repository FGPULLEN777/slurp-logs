{"nick":"lmatteis","message":"JasonSmith: a little gotcha on the pricing. A user could very well create a new account for each couch, to distribute its usage into many accounts instead into a single one","date":"2012-05-23T08:31:58.694Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"lmatteis","message":"JasonSmith: also, would you know how to deal with static content. like i'm using couch directly as a couchapp, and i serve attachments such as stylesheets and javascripts that i would like the browser to cache... in the sense that i don't want the browser to request these assets everytime... however it seems like couch response is always a 304 Not modified which isn't cached by browsers :/","date":"2012-05-23T08:46:57.935Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lmatteis","message":"just to be sure it's not possible... i guess i could use a CDN for them, but just wondering","date":"2012-05-23T08:47:17.134Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"JasonSmith","message":"I thought 304 not modified means that the browser cached it?","date":"2012-05-23T08:47:35.785Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"JasonSmith","message":"Because the browser must send (IIRC) an If-Match header","date":"2012-05-23T08:47:45.046Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lmatteis","message":"right, me too actually, but somehow it doesn't... like there's always a latency","date":"2012-05-23T08:48:08.012Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"lmatteis","message":"as you can see the other content is no loaded everytime... because it's stored in another server","date":"2012-05-23T08:50:17.417Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"lmatteis","message":"i think it's because there's no Cache-Control header","date":"2012-05-23T08:50:43.051Z","type":"message"}
