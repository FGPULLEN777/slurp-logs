{"nick":"jmdyck","message":"you could use what the spec says to define where whitespace is allowed/manadatory/forbidden, but it wouldn't be a very practical definition","date":"2017-05-22T00:03:24.998Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jmdyck","message":"something like: whitespace is allowed at a given point in a source text if the insertion/deletion of whitespace at that point doesn't make a difference to the result of parsing the source text. If it does make a difference, then whitespace at that point is mandatory or forbidden or semantic, depending on how you define those.","date":"2017-05-22T00:06:50.532Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"TabAtkins","message":"Excepting in calc() around the + and - operators, and in selectors when you want the descendant combinator, you never actually need whitespace in CSS - you can always replace it with an empty comment /**/.","date":"2017-05-22T02:41:15.423Z","type":"message"}
