{"nick":"jmdyck","message":"you could use what the spec says to define where whitespace is allowed/manadatory/forbidden, but it wouldn't be a very practical definition","date":"2017-05-22T00:03:24.998Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jmdyck","message":"something like: whitespace is allowed at a given point in a source text if the insertion/deletion of whitespace at that point doesn't make a difference to the result of parsing the source text. If it does make a difference, then whitespace at that point is mandatory or forbidden or semantic, depending on how you define those.","date":"2017-05-22T00:06:50.532Z","type":"message"}
