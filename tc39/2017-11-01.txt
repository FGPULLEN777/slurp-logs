{"nick":"jeffmo","message":"littledan: “How do you resolve it when everyone wants to be first” — the builtin module follows some convention/protocol for finding the presence of the polyfill when it initializes. That protocol is defined in such a way that it can only resolve to one thing (probably bad strawman example: tries to resolve /polyfills/<<builtinname>>.
