{"nick":"ljharb","message":"littledan: yes, my very light preference would be to require only `#x` or `this.#x`, but if we end up with both that'll be fine, it'll just be a lint rule to force one or the other","date":"2017-04-15T07:52:18.458Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"ljharb","message":"i'm saying that from a style perspective, a codebase generally should only do a given thing a single way. so it's always nicer when the number of ways to do a thing are as close to 1 as possible, since it means one less lint rule to apply.","date":"2017-04-15T07:54:35.742Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"outside of casual chatting tho, i'm not planning on pushing against #x at all. this came up because the FAQ on the private fields repo lacks a section on the shorthand, and someone pointed out that the shorthand is the only reason there's an ASI hazard requiring `this.#x`","date":"2017-04-15T07:55:45.156Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ljharb","message":"overall i think private fields, as-is, is a great feature and would rather have it (and simply implement a linting rule to enforce a single style) than risk not having it based on arguing \"shorthand or not\" ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯","date":"2017-04-15T07:56:36.477Z","type":"message"}
