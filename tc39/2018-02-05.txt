{"nick":"jmdyck","message":"to be clear,  I suggested \"types\" -> \"artefacts\" when the subject of the sentence was \"parse trees\". If the subject is \"Parse Nodes\", then \"types\" makes more sense than it did. (Although I'd put it in the singular: \"Parse Node is a specification type.\") But all that aside, I think the sentence is fine as is.","date":"2018-02-05T00:21:45.061Z","type":"message"}
