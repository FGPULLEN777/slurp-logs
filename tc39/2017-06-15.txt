{"nick":"littledan","message":"hey, someone was saying, too bad we won't get `#{...}` for immutable objects if # is taken by private. If a syntax for immutable objects is a goal, how about `%{...}` for it? A nice thing about choosing a token to set off object syntax is, object literals are already an ASI hazard, so we could use an infix operator for it without causing any sort of additional ambiguity. Another option would be `^{...}`","date":"2017-06-15T05:21:31.056Z","type":"message"}
