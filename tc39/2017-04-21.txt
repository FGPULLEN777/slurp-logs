{"nick":"dilijev","message":"I ended up getting sm, node, node-chakracore, and ch (in my case multiple versions but that's what I work on so :P) -- which covers (reasonably recent) ChakraCore, SM, and V8 -- good enough for some quick tests, maybe less so for dev work","date":"2017-04-21T04:43:05.369Z","type":"message"}
