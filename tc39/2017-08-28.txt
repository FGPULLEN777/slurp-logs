{"nick":"Bakkot","message":"I think that depend on whether you are defining \"things\" to include \"building data structures with particular asympotic time performance\" or \"building data structures which do not require any manual 'GC' \". with just WeakRefs you can simulate WeakMaps, except that a.) they will be linear access rather than log, and b.) they will require you to notice that manually GC values when the WeakRef you're using as a key stops referring.","date":"2017-08-28T05:55:58.867Z","type":"message"}
