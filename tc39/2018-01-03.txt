{"nick":"littledan","message":"Bakkot: What do you think of the option we were discussing above, where subclasses have the private static method \"brand\" but continue to throw a TypeError on reads or writes to private static fields (with the option to do the complicated semantics of a getter in subclasses)","date":"2018-01-03T00:07:06.746Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"Bakkot","message":"ambivalent? I don't like the asymetry between private static methods and private static fields - it's weird that you can use `#foo` in a subclass from `class Base { static #foo(){} }` but not from `class Base { static #foo = function(){} }`","date":"2018-01-03T00:08:27.972Z","type":"message"}
