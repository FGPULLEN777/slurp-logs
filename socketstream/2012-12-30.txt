{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"yeah, I guess there needs to be 2 (excuse the pun) streams of dev work; one to maintain 0.3, and one for 0.4","date":"2012-12-30T23:09:22.245Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"kind of, though the 0.3 codebase is horrid compared to what i know now....","date":"2012-12-30T23:09:57.445Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"owenb","message":"this new modular service layer is the best thing about 0.4 so far","date":"2012-12-30T23:13:16.055Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"owenb","message":"so i was thinking we should model the entire thing as a pipeline","date":"2012-12-30T23:13:54.284Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"we call it the websocket pipeline. in your app you're free to specify how the traffic flows by piping modules together","date":"2012-12-30T23:14:15.426Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"one of the first would be rate limiting, the second is likely to be sessions, etc","date":"2012-12-30T23:14:27.215Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"therefore EVERY message would go through these modules before they are sent to the service layer where the real work is done (RPC, LiveReload, Pub/Sub etc, Model Sync)","date":"2012-12-30T23:15:00.002Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"this is what i mean by the 'services' https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream-0.4/blob/master/example_app/app.js#L29-L32","date":"2012-12-30T23:16:40.032Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"would love to find a better name, but basically think of them as module request processors which can also send code to the client","date":"2012-12-30T23:17:01.313Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"travisdunn","message":"the rpc and livereload services would basically be default in most apps?","date":"2012-12-30T23:18:18.063Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"yes","date":"2012-12-30T23:18:26.589Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"so under this new model everything is optional, so if you don't want livereload or RPC you don't have to have it. or you can use somebody else's implementation. but to make sure new users get up and running quickly, when you generate a new project, all of this will be in and working from the start","date":"2012-12-30T23:19:24.143Z","type":"message"}
