{"nick":"avnerus","message":"oh hi owen. All is well. I've started experimenting with ss+Angular.js a few days ago and I really like it","date":"2013-04-07T21:12:41.632Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"Looking forward to v0.4 but in the mean time I'm using 0.3. I'm having this issue that makes me thing I'm probably doing something wrong because I haven't found any documentation about it","date":"2013-04-07T21:13:52.518Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"Using angular.js, I'm running an rpc call to my server the moment the controller is loaded. The problem is that it seems the ss interface is not ready and the rpc call is just ignored.","date":"2013-04-07T21:15:16.751Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"I've tried waiting for the server to be ready using ss.server.on('ready') and then it worked","date":"2013-04-07T21:15:39.845Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"but I don't know if that's a good solution because this is a controller which may or may not be loaded as the first thing in the session. For example if I'm not logged in it would be loaded only after ss is ready","date":"2013-04-07T21:16:23.422Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"(because I login first and only then access that controller)","date":"2013-04-07T21:16:42.358Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"hey, sorry, i got called away","date":"2013-04-07T21:46:07.260Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"just reading now","date":"2013-04-07T21:46:09.188Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"ok i understand the problem","date":"2013-04-07T21:47:50.101Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"normally the best thing to do is put all your angular controllers outside of SS, but then call a command in one of them to init() your app once the connection has been started","date":"2013-04-07T21:48:35.818Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"regardless of whether or not the user has logged in","date":"2013-04-07T21:48:45.284Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"hmm I see..but then how would the other controllers wait for that init() before loading?","date":"2013-04-07T21:50:47.711Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"they can still load, but they shouldn't call any ss.rpc() methods until they have the OK to do so","date":"2013-04-07T21:51:09.659Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"I see. so you mean I should use some kind of internal event. Is there any standard way in javascript to do such a thing? something like 'if the app is not ready yet, wait for init'","date":"2013-04-07T21:52:24.497Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"not really. it's about the connection being up and open, rather than the app being ready as such","date":"2013-04-07T22:00:20.317Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"btw i'm hoping for a much smoother SocketStream + Angular integration in the near future","date":"2013-04-07T22:00:47.473Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"with plenty of demo apps","date":"2013-04-07T22:00:49.967Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"just taking one step at a time. need to finish the core server first","date":"2013-04-07T22:00:59.704Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"yeah don't rush it :) how about since ss-angular is already encapsulating rpc, I can add there that if app is not loaded (some global var) it will wait for ss.server.on('ready') and only then fire the rpc?","date":"2013-04-07T22:02:17.250Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"well basically something must always make the first call the server. typically this will be to see if a user is logged in","date":"2013-04-07T22:04:50.970Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"all you need to do is disable your app (hide a div etc) until that first call is made","date":"2013-04-07T22:05:08.790Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"and only make the first call when the ready event fires","date":"2013-04-07T22:05:24.247Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"ah yes I already do that actually. only that it loads simultaneously with the other contoller. hmm yeah I guess I should just that the app at something like /sessionCheck and then redirect to / once all is good","date":"2013-04-07T22:08:50.696Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"*start the app at","date":"2013-04-07T22:09:09.420Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"ss-angular is built in such a way that you append an [auth] module to your controller and once it loads it makes the login check. so I guess I should just have a separate controller for the initialization and not append it to my main controller","date":"2013-04-07T22:11:06.510Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"yes indeed. that should help","date":"2013-04-07T22:17:03.120Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"owenb","message":"sorry it's all a bit unclear and like the wild west at the moment. it will get better for sure","date":"2013-04-07T22:17:21.730Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"it's ok. I'm happy to be at the beginning of a new generation of web apps :)","date":"2013-04-07T22:18:00.662Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avnerus","message":"We have considered using Derby or Meteor but each had its own problems which made it too risky.

{"nick":"avnerus","message":"ok I'm afraid have to go. Thanks for help! I will probably be visiting with some more questions in the near future. gn","date":"2013-04-07T22:26:34.657Z","type":"message"}
