{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"@freezy3k - I saw your query from last night. Currently there isn't a way to add a custom logger. I did have a look into finding a way to omit logging here: https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/issues/380","date":"2013-08-15T11:32:34.576Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"freezy3k","message":"paulbjensen: well i've had a look at the code and some of the logs can be overritten by redefining ss.api.log.","date":"2013-08-15T12:43:51.469Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"freezy3k","message":"not all though, the publish logs directly use console.log in the code","date":"2013-08-15T12:44:16.796Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"yeah, I wanted to get them all using ss.api.log, but that requires making the ss.api variable available to them in some way","date":"2013-08-15T12:45:11.233Z","type":"message"}
