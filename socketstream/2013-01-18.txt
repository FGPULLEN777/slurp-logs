As an aside, one thing I've debated with myself is whether SS is a good fit other classes of applications - ones where changes are broadcast to very few clients (e.g. only 1-3).  Sort of like everyone having a personal chat.  I suppose the question is how much memory is required per client?","date":"2013-01-18T17:50:42.778Z","type":"message"}
