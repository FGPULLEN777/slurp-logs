{"nick":"burninggramma","message":"hey guys. I've got an issue when using redis for sessions. I'm running redis-commander for debugging the sessions. For some reason if I refresh its view (queries for keys with prefix) the existing session are removed inside my SocketStream app.","date":"2014-07-22T20:08:54.673Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"burninggramma","message":"Without refreshing the redis-commander everything seems fine, I just want to understand why could a look up query have such an effect on the session handling.","date":"2014-07-22T20:08:54.856Z","type":"message"}
