{"nick":"zenocon","message":"well, you can still probably download an html partial from server or do a client side include template like you have done already","date":"2012-11-20T19:11:58.913Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"ArxPoetica","message":"Davis.js, for example, acts more like a req/res --> just identify the route and do whatever you want","date":"2012-11-20T19:12:15.556Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"zenocon","message":"y, well the server-side catch-all delivers index.jade, and the angular can add an otherwise() clause to redirect to / or /home","date":"2012-11-20T19:19:04.225Z","type":"message"}
