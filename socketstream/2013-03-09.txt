{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"great minds think alike","date":"2013-03-09T11:50:35.723Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"so, I had a similar idea, but not database-based","date":"2013-03-09T11:51:00.537Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"I built this toy concept of listening for all the routes that your Backbone app would make to the server,","date":"2013-03-09T11:51:24.847Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"and at first they don't exist, but they would be logged in a admin interface","date":"2013-03-09T11:51:51.393Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"and then, you'd write the controller and action for it, then reload that server-side code in the app, and then map the route to that controller action, then boom, you build the API on the fly from the Backbone app","date":"2013-03-09T11:52:39.736Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"andrewreedy","message":"yea that would be really cool","date":"2013-03-09T11:53:28.301Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"the flip side to that is to use HATEOAS to communicate the API schema to your client-side app, routes, attributes, semantic details","date":"2013-03-09T11:53:45.330Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"paulbjensen","message":"then, the client-side would automatically generate the models, UI views to correspond to that API","date":"2013-03-09T11:54:26.518Z","type":"message"}
