My understanding is that v8 parses your code into an AST, which gets 'runtime' executed as you said.  In the case of a block (function level) being executed a lot, v8 will then try to JIT it and perform optimizations on it.  In the case of 'disabled optimizations', I believe it means it is forcing all the steps ","date":"2013-11-25T08:09:20.670Z","type":"message"}
