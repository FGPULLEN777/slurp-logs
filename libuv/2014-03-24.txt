{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"trevnorris: the grand compromise is that the majority of the tracing api would be stuck behind a private module, and then exposed through an npm installable 'tracing' module such that we can iterate through the mechanism more easily","date":"2014-03-24T23:00:54.154Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"tjfontaine: right now I\"m not going to operate under those constraints. When I have the PR at the point where it's functioning as it should then I'll begin defining the points of contact that need to be exposed to the tracing module.","date":"2014-03-24T23:02:43.196Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"tjfontaine: i understand. and i'm working furiously to finish a couple fundamentals. there are a few things that will have to be exposed from the JS side from core in order for the external tracing module to work.","date":"2014-03-24T23:05:08.129Z","type":"message"}
