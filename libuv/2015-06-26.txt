{"nick":"jasnell_","message":"there will be more to come. soon I'm going to start focusing on specific modules: e.g. all the streams related items, all the crypto related items, etc","date":"2015-06-26T17:33:02.382Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jgi","message":"jasnell_: why do we land doc PRs in master instead of in v0.12 when it applies there too?","date":"2015-06-26T17:34:53.878Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jasnell_","message":"jgi: at this point I'm largely organizing the work to see where things need to land. notice it's just the doc stuff that I've been landing in master.

{"nick":"jasnell_","message":"I know it's a bit different than the process the project has followed before, but since there are so many moving parts to track landing in master then working backwards helps me keep things a bit more organized","date":"2015-06-26T17:38:56.594Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jgi","message":"jasnell_: historically I think PRs landed in the oldest maintained branch where they apply, and then bubble up to master as branches are merged into more recent maintained versions (v0.10 into v0.12, and then v0.12 into master)","date":"2015-06-26T17:39:09.416Z","type":"message"}
