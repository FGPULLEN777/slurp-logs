{"nick":"_KryDos_","message":"hi :) I'm trying to make my first contribution in libuv and want to start with https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/829 . I'm sure I'm smart enought to change 6 to 8 :D I also noticed that test-platform-output.c outputs uv_interface_addresses and of course it printfs phys_addr. It prints each char seperatelly. The question is, should I change this behaviour somehow also? thank you ","date":"2017-05-06T10:45:19.458Z","type":"message"}
