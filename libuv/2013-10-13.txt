{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"othiym23: cool. yeah, way I set it up is that any callback (listener, before, after, error) is not allowed to throw.","date":"2013-10-13T21:41:13.722Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"If they do then it'll still call the error callback once more for any handling purposes, but then bubble afterwards.","date":"2013-10-13T21:41:13.951Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"othiym23: coolio. to be honest the timers bother me because the logic is non-trivial with creating TimerWrap instances along with individual timer objects added to the linked list.","date":"2013-10-13T21:45:42.961Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"othiym23","message":"my approach is pretty simple (because it creates closures that get around all of the linked list logic), but it's still surprisingly subtle","date":"2013-10-13T21:46:33.954Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"othiym23","message":"it was mostly fine for my purposes, but the polyfill wasn't dealing with nested timers correctly, and it was only the fact that CLS never removes the listener that prevented that bug from being exercised","date":"2013-10-13T21:48:28.851Z","type":"message"}
