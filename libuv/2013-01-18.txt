{"nick":"TooTallNate","message":"they just keep a reference to \"parent\"","date":"2013-01-18T22:53:12.113Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"so how does the parent know when there are no more fast buffers pointing to it?","date":"2013-01-18T22:53:30.113Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"TooTallNate","message":"so that doesn't get GC'd until after all the fast buffers with references to that parent are gone","date":"2013-01-18T22:54:03.532Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"TooTallNate","message":"trevnorris: in JS, an object will never be GC'd as long as another object is keeping a reference to it","date":"2013-01-18T22:55:20.575Z","type":"message"}
