{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"TooTallNate: yes, I'm specifying a full path, and in this case no extension is in the filename, for a workaround for now in the extension check I just added a try{ fs.statSync() }","date":"2012-09-20T02:28:42.150Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"TooTallNate: though, if someone were to want to (for whatever reason) try and get bindings.node they would hit the same issue","date":"2012-09-20T02:29:16.150Z","type":"message"}
