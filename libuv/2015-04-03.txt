{"nick":"miles","message":"how is it intended to be used? i dont see much difference between UV_RUN_DEFAULT and UV_RUN_NOWAIT as it us to be honest. i dont see the usefulness of the latter if with UV_RUN_NOWAIT we cannot know when there are no more events occurring.","date":"2015-04-03T23:23:20.639Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"miles","message":"the reason we want it non blocking imo is that we want to process some events and then continue other tasks while waiting for events, hence why i would see it more logic for UV_RUN_NOWAIT to return the number of pending events to be processed, apart from the ref'ed handles (so it returns 0 if theres no events to be processed)","date":"2015-04-03T23:24:32.976Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"avalanche123","message":"miles: you want to wait until you have something to do, as to not burn the CPU. If you want to do something periodically or otherwise in between io polls, use timers, prepare and idle handles","date":"2015-04-03T23:27:39.453Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"avalanche123","message":"ah, I think the issue is that, as far as I can tell, libuv loop is designed with different assumptions in mind, e.g. not for strictly realtime systems, you might have to use something else in realtime context, like QP Framework...","date":"2015-04-03T23:34:02.464Z","type":"message"}
