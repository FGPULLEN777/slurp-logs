{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"bnoordhuis: also, is it bad for an inherited class to depend on the parent class having implemented some type of functionality?","date":"2013-11-04T23:28:16.767Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"bnoordhuis: e.g. SSLWrap uses Unwrap<Base>(), but doesn't actually store the object itself. just uses args.This().","date":"2013-11-04T23:28:52.586Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"now, class Connection also uses Unwrap, so it's apparent that it needs that functionality. but if some class inherited SSLWrap w/o needing to Unwrap, SSLWrap wouldn't have that available.","date":"2013-11-04T23:30:15.193Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"basically, SSLWrap just does an Unwrap on args.This() depending on the fact the inheriting class set the class pointer on the object.","date":"2013-11-04T23:31:14.875Z","type":"message"}
