{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"baz: not really, a crude implementation would be to just change .encrypt and .decrypt to [].push() and then proxy the cb which would then check if there are more actions to be performed","date":"2012-12-14T22:09:40.588Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"stagas","message":"baz: the queue won't scale also beyond one node process, so a cluster all trying to decrypt will fail again. I think you shouldn't use a queue and fail, then a higher level abstraction should take care of that","date":"2012-12-14T22:15:59.627Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"stagas","message":"baz: also are there any docs online for scrypt? can't seem to find anything beyond the pdf","date":"2012-12-14T22:17:37.657Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"stagas","message":"baz: anyway, I believe the expected behavior of scrypt is not to allow you to run multiple decryptions in parallel and the error is normal since you try to do 50 of them. that's like brute force, the thing it's trying to solve by using sequential key derivation functions","date":"2012-12-14T22:28:16.860Z","type":"message"}
