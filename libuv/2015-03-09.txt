{"nick":"jgi","message":"tyleranton: no, you should be good to go. If there’s anything that we need to change after the review (e.g the commit message or the changes themselves) you’ll be able to do that in the same PR.","date":"2015-03-09T01:37:45.825Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tyleranton","message":"jgi: Alright, great. I’ll create it then.","date":"2015-03-09T01:38:21.942Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"jgi","message":"tyleranton: did you push after squashing them?","date":"2015-03-09T01:40:48.036Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tyleranton","message":"jgi: Ah, I didn’t since there weren’t any changes to commit. I’m assuming I need to do so regardless?","date":"2015-03-09T01:42:02.982Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jgi","message":"tyleranton: yes, you need to push the new tree to your remote so that github gets the tree with the one squashed commit","date":"2015-03-09T01:43:01.429Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"jgi","message":"tyleranton: you’ll need to force push too, by using git push -f your_remote fix-issue-9313","date":"2015-03-09T01:44:36.556Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tyleranton","message":"jgi: Alright, my bad. Pushing without changes didn’t register in my head ha. I’ll do it real quick.","date":"2015-03-09T01:44:50.559Z","type":"message"}
