{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"oh a listener isn't for incoming connections?","date":"2013-07-26T23:51:02.263Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"well, there is a listner for the incoming connection, but then the connection can send data.","date":"2013-07-26T23:51:47.907Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"or alternatively you have an event that only takes at most one listener, that is really-really-closed and the user is responsible for cleaning the rest up","date":"2013-07-26T23:55:42.086Z","type":"message"}
