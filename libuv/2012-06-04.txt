{"nick":"bnoordhuis","message":"piscisaureus_: it's kind of odd... i see the server hanging indefinitely in epoll_wait while the timeout is < 3 sec","date":"2012-06-04T23:46:40.151Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"loladiro","message":"Yeah, it's gonna be pretty much like that, except for libuv creating the fd on demand and automatically choosing the input/output handle, so that the user doesn't have to deal with that","date":"2012-06-04T23:46:40.381Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"piscisaureus_","message":"loladiro: althought there is no uv api for it, I think it's quite easy to get what you want even without libuv's help. The api you're looking for is called pipe(2) on unix and CreatePipe on windows :-)","date":"2012-06-04T23:46:40.381Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"loladiro","message":"piscisaureus_: I know. I want to incorporate in into uv_spawn though, as I am relucatant to add extra plaform code around it. If you don't think that belongs in libuv, I guess I could make it work with UV_INHERIT_FD","date":"2012-06-04T23:47:44.846Z","type":"message"}
