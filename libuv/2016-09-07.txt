I have seen some example libuv code use uv_write with a uv_write_t handle allocated on a stack inside a subroutine, like here: https://gist.github.com/Jxck/4305806#file-client-c-L76 . Am I right assuming that this is illegal, and the uv_write_t should be malloced from the uv_write caller and freed by the write end callback?","date":"2016-09-07T09:39:05.612Z","type":"message"}
