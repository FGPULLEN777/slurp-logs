{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"2) requiring a listener while also allowing a default storage value to be passed is stupid.","date":"2013-11-15T23:51:31.575Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"trevnorris","message":"groundwater_: so, I think \"the\" async listener should be wrapped into the main callbacks object as \"create\" or some such","date":"2013-11-15T23:52:01.702Z","type":"message"}
