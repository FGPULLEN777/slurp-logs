{"nick":"andos","message":"Hi. Quick question I can’t seem to find an answer for in the documentation:  With the libuv filesystem listener in the case of a file rename event, how do I get the old vs new filename? Currently it seems to fire the event twice in a row, first with the old filename and then with the new. Not very easy to use. Is there a better way?
