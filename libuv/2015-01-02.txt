{"nick":"mkrufky","message":"Im using libuv to write some nodejs bindings for running c jobs on an embedded device.  Many of the device's firmware functions are long-running blocking calls, which is fine - I use uv_queue_work to run them async.  The problem is, only one of those firmware functions can be called at a time. Temporarily, I am using a mutex to run the firmware jobs one at a time and prevent the firmware jobs from clobbering each other,","date":"2015-01-02T22:29:36.145Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"mkrufky","message":"but this causes the other non-firmware jobs to be delayed until the firmware blocking calls empty from the threadpool. The way I see it, Id like to have a special loop that runs in a separate threadpool containing only one thread, and queue the firmware jobs to that loop, but this doesn't look possible with libuv. Am I wrong, or is there a better solution that im not thinking of?","date":"2015-01-02T22:29:44.246Z","type":"message"}
