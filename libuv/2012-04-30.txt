{"nick":"pfox__","message":"indutny: yeah, it will","date":"2012-04-30T15:22:41.718Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"it'll take a uv_loop_t* and a cb","date":"2012-04-30T15:22:47.317Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"indutny","message":"yeah","date":"2012-04-30T15:22:51.696Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"so why do you need filtering then?","date":"2012-04-30T15:23:01.663Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"because uv_walk is important in the context of the refcount refactor","date":"2012-04-30T15:23:13.803Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"and, in the world of refcount refactor, handles have several potential states","date":"2012-04-30T15:23:27.569Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"open, closed, active, inactive.. combinations thereof","date":"2012-04-30T15:23:34.417Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"yes","date":"2012-04-30T15:23:38.865Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"so maybe the user just wants inactive but unclosed handles?","date":"2012-04-30T15:23:51.147Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"hm.. that's why callback is here","date":"2012-04-30T15:24:02.932Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"like, if uv_run() returns early and the user needs to clean-up the un-closed handles","date":"2012-04-30T15:24:08.090Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"you can select everything you want","date":"2012-04-30T15:24:08.560Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"indeed","date":"2012-04-30T15:24:26.657Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"i think uv_walk will return all unclosed handles","date":"2012-04-30T15:24:33.441Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"and users can use predicate functions to work on inactive handles or whatever.. like in the use-case above","date":"2012-04-30T15:24:50.225Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"although, if uv_run() has returned, chances are everything is inactive","date":"2012-04-30T15:25:00.841Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"but you could use uv_walk while the loop is still running, too","date":"2012-04-30T15:25:16.896Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"pfox__: it should be called uv_filter_walk then","date":"2012-04-30T15:25:53.778Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"pfox__: because it has different purpose indeed","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:07.314Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"indutny: chances are there won't be a filter in the uv_walk()","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:12.188Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"it'll do an O(n) iteration on open handles","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:20.630Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"pfox__: aaaah","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:28.107Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"and users can use predicate functions (uv_is_active, etc)","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:29.183Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"I got you","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:30.322Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"to select the ones they want","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:35.661Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"you want uv to keep various lists","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:38.082Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"so all operations will be O(1)","date":"2012-04-30T15:26:48.747Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"I mean list querying","date":"2012-04-30T15:27:05.031Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"no.. there'll be a single linked list, probably, that has open handles","date":"2012-04-30T15:27:10.814Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"tjfontaine","message":"but there was some discussion on that as well","date":"2012-04-30T15:27:21.362Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"indutny","message":"oh crap, things are hard :P","date":"2012-04-30T15:27:30.796Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"well, i guess first, i need to nail down ev_walk's behavior","date":"2012-04-30T15:27:38.715Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"and build the win32 stuff around that","date":"2012-04-30T15:27:42.445Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"ideally, i can use a single linked list that is only added/taken-from when handles are *_init()'d and uv_close()'d","date":"2012-04-30T15:28:05.884Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"give the user everything and let them decide how to use it.","date":"2012-04-30T15:28:21.683Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"pfox__","message":"ideally.","date":"2012-04-30T15:28:25.130Z","type":"message"}
