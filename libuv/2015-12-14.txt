{"nick":"cjihrig","message":"well on unix, if we used getpwuid(), it contains a pw_name string. so we could have strings all around","date":"2015-12-14T21:07:01.307Z","type":"message"}
{"nick":"saghul","message":"yeah, but on Unix the integers are what matters really... so I'm not sure how much trouble we want to get into","date":"2015-12-14T21:09:10.996Z","type":"message"}

{"nick":"saghul","message":"kellabyte: libuv will just read the amount of bytes you allow it to, the suggested size is just a suggestion","date":"2015-12-14T21:18:30.104Z","type":"message"}
