{"nick":"jacres","message":"hi everyone, I'm reading UDP packets, but it seems that I'm only able to process one packet per update loop. For example, if I'm sending 100 packets/second, but my receiving application is running the loop at 40 times/second, i'm always going to be behind. Is there a way to process all packets that are sitting in the recive buffer?","date":"2017-04-28T16:01:41.844Z","type":"message"}
