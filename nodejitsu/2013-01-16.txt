{"nick":"blakmatrix","message":"filmaj: I like to think that once your app is \"started\", you get back that it started and is ok, that thats when the startup garbage Collection takes place.... but I'm not devops so i dont know for sure, I just know that startup process is crucial and takes quite a bit of the 256 MB RAM, and that in general any extra \"stuff\" you do before listening on a port increases the chance the app will have a memory leak ","date":"2013-01-16T22:52:41.077Z","type":"message"}
